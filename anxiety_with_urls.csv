I started making online friends due to covid. I started playing online RPGs (like D&amp;D) to make friends and practice social interactions. All interactions happen pretty much through discord. There's one person I really feel a friendly connection with and like to talk to and message. But he seems like a very reserved person and I'm always initiating contact.
We've messaged for hours yesterday and the day before. So now I feel anxiety about messaging him again because I don't want to seem needy or bother him. I'm just not sure if he's too nice to tell me I bother him or if he likes to talk to me. I also can't ask him that because I feel anxious about that, too.
I don't want to ruin a potential great friendship. So now I'm kind of in this awkward state of checking my discord every 5 minutes...seeing that he's online and closing it again because I'm afraid 😭

I'm vaxxed and boosted, but tested positive for covid on Dec 28th. It seemed pretty mild, and symptoms felt like a cold and lasted for about 3 days.  I went on a ski trip 10 days later.  First day, everything was fine. Second day, I got winded a few times and by the end of the day, I couldnt catch my breath on a run and went into the lodge to sit down. I ended up almost passing out and (I think) hyperventilating.  The bartender called ski patrol, but by the time they got there, I was sitting up and ok.  The pulse oximeter said that my oxygen levels were fine.  


The 3rd day, I was super winded just getting dressed. I went to the mountain with my friends, but I was winded just walking around, so I ended up not skiing that day.

Upon arriving home from the trip, I began having breathing issues that resemble several older posts I've read about ""air hunger"".  I'll feel like I cant catch my breath which then seems to turn into a panic attack.  I ended up going to the ER one night because I felt like I was suffocating.  They did a chest xray and CT scan and found no issues.  Again, pulse oximeter was high 90's the entire time and they sent me home with one that is always 97 or higher when I test it.

I've since seen a cardiologist. They said my heart pumps slightly less blood volume than it should and there is mild enlargement, but nothing that should cause these types of issues.  For the most part my tests were ""normal"".

I've basically been couchbound for the last 3 weeks. I get winded when I walk my dog and I have these hyperventilation panic attacks when just sitting at my desk working.  I wake up every day feeling ""ok"" and then it seems to get worse as the day goes on.  If I eat an edible or drink some wine after work, I seem to either feel more relaxed or think less about my breathing.. which makes me think it's anxiety.  

It's just wild to me that it seemingly came out of nowhere and prior to the ski trip and getting covid, I used to workout 6 days a week and be very active.  I get winded now when I eat, so I've lost over 10 lbs and I dont really even like to drive my car because I'm afraid I'm going to have a ""breathing episode"".

On the other hand, it could also be from anxiety if you are always thinking about it. If you’re thinking about it, you pay attention to it a lot more and notice things you might it have before, which then may cause panic attacks.

So to keep it kind of brief, I'm a 22 year old male. I spent alot of my teenage years kind of dicking around. I've only recently started reading and finding myself wanting to learn alot more new things. Until I heard that after the age 25 your brain starts to deteriorate/stop growing.

Around 5 months ago today I had gone through a stressful event where I was made to believe that I was having a psychotic episode (hearing things, specifically) and I developed what seems to be an anxiety disorder from what I noticed.

*My sleep's been heavily impacted

*I cant enjoy the same things I used to love to the same degree

*I'm over vigilant about sounds in my environment, which elevates my anxiety

*I dont workout anymore, cant bring myself out of the house

*I over rely on stimulation to keep my anxiety at bay, I cant sit still or relax anymore

*I get feelings of derealization very easily throughout the day

*Suicidal thoughts 

I've been on Lexapro for it for around 3 months now but I havent noticed any changes and I never really wanted to be on it so I'm currently tapering off with the help of my psychiatrist.

I've tried tele counseling twice now but the service I used was too inconsistent and vague in communication so I stopped. No other services like it where I live either.

TLDR; Something stressful happened and it brought on symptoms of an anxiety disorder with it but I'm not sure what exactly is going on. I feel helpless and lost.

"sizyz5","pachecoforlife","/r/Anxiety/comments/sizyz5/severe_anxiety_for_two_years_still_trying_to/",1,1643836163,"Hello reddit friends, 

Just got over an anxiety attack here and just feel like I need some guidance from others to really find a way to go through this journey since I never really have people to relate to. 

A little bit of background, I have been suffering from severe anxiety for the last two years (I am 25 years old). Commonly what I feel is that I am going to have a heart attack, with my heart racing (110-120 bpm), and this fear of dying from a heart attack. I think it stems from the fact that my family has a lot of heart problems. I have really bad muscle tension in my neck and upper back, as well as the left side of my chest, where I am constantly popping my shoulder and that muscle as a trigger from my anxiety. 

Overall, I have gone through quite a lot of hardships and loss (this includes my mom and many other family members). I have a really heavy past as a kid/teen and it carries a lot of weight that brings me down at times. 

In addition, there was one incident where four years ago, I partied a lot and one time I did experience chest pain and was in the hospital because my body was so dehydrated from alcohol, and it inflamed my organs including my heart. There was another time I mixed some drugs and just had a bad reaction in my chest.  Even thought that year I was less anxious, I felt like I did some damage to myself.

Fast forward to now, I am doing much better in many regards. I am the first in my family to complete college, have a good job, an amazing girlfriend, I live on my own (will be with my GF next month!), and overall I am living a much more calm life, without all the crazy parties and bad experiences I had in the past. I been making every move to take care of myself such as diet, working out, etc.

YET, I am just so goddamn anxious. I think a majority if it does stem from work stress (first job out of college came with way more responsibilities). But I still have this underlying fear that my heart is going to give out. I have gone to doctors and they said I am fine and its just anxiety. Maybe so, but I am always in doubt because many of my family members have heart problems and have their first heart attacks in their 40's (I even had a cousin die of one in his 30s). I think I have just witness so much death that it has really heighten my anxiety along with the stress that I have been dealing with. 

As far as taking care of myself, I have been trying to work out, do yoga, and practice meditation as a way to handle anxiety, especially because I feel it almost more physically than mentally. Yet, I feel like those natural ways of haven't shown the best results. I have just started therapy 3 weeks ago so I hope that helps. Also I am coming to terms that I probably have to lay off the weed. I love smoking but it has been hitting me different in the last year. Ether way, I am trying to make changes that will help me in the most natural way. 

A family doctor prescribed me Lorazepam, but I have been against taking it because I seen how prescription drugs messed up my mom, which she eventually grew a dependence and died from them. I only take Lorazepam when I feel like I REALLY need it (once every 1-2 months), in an emergency (for example, I took it right now because my heart was just racing so much and I was losing my shit and need to do work). Yet, at the end of the day, I just want to avoid meds all together.

I think what I need is just to be aware that things are better than they were in the past, and that I am a healthy person. I am making steps to handle my anxiety in a natural way and just have to keep up with the routine. 

If anyone has tips or advice on how they address their anxiety naturally, especially the type of the anxiety that is physical, that would be great!

I had a sudden episode of heart palpitations and difficulty breathing while I was sitting on my desk. It was not accompanied by pain, sweating or any other discomfort.. 
This event had my anxiety escalated and I would get palpitations everyday and I still have them(even just after a full night's sleep).

 I feel like my heart stops for a second and then it beats with a Jolt. This spikes my anxiety and a feeling of an impending doom sets in and I feel like I would die.

Any minor inconvenience would trigger my anxiety, even my thoughts provoked anxiety. Then on I started being too aware of my heart.
I feel I am now trapped in a vicious cycle and I  can't figure a way out of this.

Doctors had my Chest x-ray, ECG, blood reports checked and they say there's no structural or functional abnormalities. But I still feel there's something wrong

My exhaustion was through the roof, I literally couldn't do anything without feeling like I was going to drop.

Long story short, it was discovered that I have quite severe sleep apnea which was causing the exhaustion and likely exacerbating the depression and anxiety. I only received my CPAP machine three weeks ago and decided to go back to work even though I still feel exhausted (it takes roughly three months to see improvements and to reverse the damage its done to your brain/body).

Since I've been off work, I became agoraphobic, I couldn't go outside of the house for longer than 30 minutes because the anxiety of my exhaustion made me feel as if I was going to pass out or have a huge panic attack. I couldn't drive for longer than 20 minutes without stopping because of the same fear. I couldn't go anywhere, even for a meal or do anything enjoyable. I had zero energy, every day felt as if I'd been awake for 48 hours whilst also being stuck in fight or flight mode every minute of every day.

I went back today and it took me hours to work up the courage to go there. Driving there I resisted the urge to turn back. I got there and it felt good to get back, but after only three hours of being back I felt this incredible exhaustion slowly creep over me. Today was the longest I've been out of the house, plus I went back in to work, plus I drove there and back and I met a bunch of new people.

I don't see any success in what I did today. I feel like a failure because I was so exhausted only after only being there for a few hours. I could of literally fallen asleep if I had rested my head. It concerns me because I don't want to fail, I don't want to be unable to perform my duties because I'm overcome with incredible exhaustion.

I'm not fishing for compliments or for people to tell me I did well, like I said, I only see today as a big failure.

How do you get yourself out of that mindset? I'm starting to understand that I have performance/health anxiety and that when I sense or feel any negative feelings relating to those things, I perceive it as a failure. I feel tired, failure. I feel trapped or worried about going somewhere unfamiliar, failure. It's as if I write myself off for having the feeling, regardless of how I act on it.

Upon further research, I really don’t feel comfortable taking an antipsychotic off label for anxiety as my first medication trial. I also spoke to my grandmother about it (my primary parent growing up) and apparently my mother was put on Seroquel for her schizophrenia and did not have a good reaction to it at all because of a heart condition I also have. I mentioned this to my doctor and he said I should be fine because they will give me EKGs, however I am still just not comfortable. 

While talking to my grandmother about this, she mentioned that she was prescribed Zoloft to quit smoking, but it made a significant difference in her experience with anxiety and PTSD. I did a little more research and I’m seeing that Zoloft is not only one of the few medications approved to treat social anxiety, but it also is one of the easiest on the heart!

She messaged me about a post of mine and after the conversation about it, I thought she was interesting and wanted to be her friend and she agreed. I just wanted to be her friend because she already has a girlfriend.

Since that day, we talked every single day about something or the other through texting. We discussed so many things and exchanged so much knowledge and stories and she was a wholesome friend. She liked memes and cute animals and I used to send her these pictures. I was excited for her for the things going on in her life. One day she decided to come out to her Brother and Mother as a Lesbian and I supported her and was worried if something bad would happen. The same day, she didn't message for many hours(this is not typical because we used to talk in short bursts throughout the day) and I was really worried if something bad happened that made her very sad. Like we used to send each other hug GIFs when we are sad. She reciprocated these feelings too to some extent.

Few days ago, I felt very sick. I had severe headaches, body pains and was having it pretty bad. I didn't message her for 2-3 days and really felt that I should tell her about my health but I had no strength to even open my eyes. My fucking brain thought that she would be worried about me because I, who she talked to every single day for months, suddenly stopped talking. As soon as I gained strength, I opened our chat and saw that she didn't even send me a single fucking message asking about what happened. Tears literally welled up in my eyes. Like what was lacking from my side that she doesn't even care about me? I really consider her a good friend. I can understand that she may be busy but, that's not the case because she made all the time in the world to post and comment on Social Media. It really feels like I was part of a discussion where I just exchanged information with a complete stranger whose face I don't even know. It was not friendship building as I had thought.

Two weeks ago I had a job interview which went great. I was very nervous before hand, but during the interview I was ok. It was only 50 minutes so I new I would be over before I knew it. I have the tendency to sweat a lot and I stink most of the time afterwards because of my axienty, so this time was not any different. Anyway, I got the job and I have a great feeling about it. We set the day to start on the 15th of February. I thought this would be a regular workday, but a couple of days later they emailed me that it was a great way to get to know everyone because it's a teamday. I always hated days like this.. I always get so, so nervous. My belly aches and I have to go to the toilet countless times. I sweat and I stink if I don't wear the right clothes. 

This morning I rechieved the program of the day which starts at 9 and ends at 5. SO LONG. We have to wear comfy clothes, because we are going to move ugh, whatever that means. They are presenting something which I hate because it makes me extra nervous because I have the feeling that it is not socially desirable to stand up and leave. People expect you to stay and listen. So it triggers my axienty. Most of the time I get bellyaches, I start shaking and I have to go to the restroom. People don't notice my pannicy moments. 

But the worst part of the program is that we have an activity described as 'something completly different' and I don't know what it is. It is repetitive so we have to do this like three times.. I really don't like to be suprised. 

I have bellyaches already.. What would you do? Just go and suffer? Tell them how you feel and go? Or tell them about my axienty and say you prefer an other moment the start the job? I don't know. Help. FWI, I'm in therapy and I will talk about it Monday with my group. But that is like in three days and I had to vent.

"sk74pt","throwaway284637","/r/Anxiety/comments/sk74pt/am_i_bad_person_for_not_being_vaccinated_yet/",1,1643958774,"TW: health conditions, covid vaccine, side effects

Let me start this by saying I’m not an antivaxxer by any means. I hate all the conspiracy theories and conservative mumbo jumbo, I think it’s idiotic and dangerous. I’m also a leftist and have tons of compassion for people (if not too much). I’ve worn a mask since the start of the pandemic, I social distance whenever possible, I test myself, etc. 

But here’s the thing: I have really bad anxiety and also a complicated medical history. I have 3 autoimmune conditions that I know of (2 are officially diagnosed and could have fairly serious consequences if they progress or if I have too much inflammation in my body), meaning I’m also highly susceptible to developing more for seemingly any reason. And I’ve heard of people getting autoimmune conditions from the vaccine. I also have sensitivities to gluten/wheat, sugar, and dairy and I’m prone to flare ups, sometimes for the dumbest reasons (extremely sore wrists and painful joints from texting too much or accidentally eating a small amount of gluten, for example). I’ve also had a swollen lymph node in my neck since last September so an ENT recommended I get an MRI at some point soon. I have pretty severe health anxiety, depression, and other issues on top of all that including tinnitus (which I’ve heard the vaccine often causes to worsen). 

So I have a lot going for me lol. And seeing as there aren’t any long term studies on people with my issues receiving the covid vaccine, I’m hesitant to get it. I know the CDC says it’s safe for now and I believe them, but they simply don’t know the long term effects. None of us do. And I can’t afford to have a bad reaction to the vaccine when I just started working again or possibly develop another autoimmune condition (like lupus) that could kill me or cause severe lifelong problems. I know covid carries risks that are far greater but I’m pretty sure I got infected with the worst strain in early 2020 (didn’t think it was possible at the time bc there were no known cases in my state yet) and yet I recovered alone in 5-7 days total with no severe side effects that I know of. 

Plus knowing that omicron is spreading fast even amongst vaccinated people makes me even more hesitant. 

But the current attitude seems to be that all unvaxxed people are selfish and disgusting, but I wouldn’t be unvaxxed if I didn’t have legitimate reasons. I would’ve gotten it right away if I didn’t have any health conditions or health anxiety :/ I do think the people who refuse to get it bc they’re conservative Christians or simply bc they don’t care about protecting others are absolutely selfish. There’s no doubt about that. 
But I just genuinely don’t know how my body will react to it, especially since it’s likely we’ll have to get boosters every few months for it to be effective so that means immune reactions (and potential bad reactions) every few months for god knows how long. 

But I still feel like a shit person for being scared of getting the vaccine. I’ve made 3 appointments in the last year and cancelled them all at the last minute. I also feel like shit for debating whether or not to tell new people, especially before first dates. They might think I’m a terrible selfish person and not even give me the chance to explain, but don’t they have a right to know? They may have loved ones who are immunocompromised so it’s within their right to have a boundary about vaccines even if someone tests negative. 

So yeah I just have no clue what to do or how to stop feeling like a bad person for struggling with this","Am I bad person for not being vaccinated yet?","Advice Needed","hvjcfhx","callmeconfused2","/r/Anxiety/comments/sk74pt/am_i_bad_person_for_not_being_vaccinated_yet/hvjcfhx/",1,1643961970,"Not at all!

So i've dealt with anxiety before, but i've noticed the past few months it seems to be escalating very quickly and anxiety attacks more often than ever before. Like usually it was just mild/moderate social anxiety and general anxiety, but lately i've been getting anxiety at such random times about random things such as death, being sick, health anxiety, existential stuff. It'll trigger me to the point of crying for hours or feeling like the world is going to end for the whole day. pretty much fight or flight mode
constantly, and especially bad disassociation/ derealization lately where I literally feel like i'm losing my mind and it terrifies me to wonder if i've lost my sense of reality/ if other people notice and i'm not aware. it's making it impossible to enjoy nice life moments and make memories because i'm always in my head.

I have had an abortion, lost a close friend, and then this pandemic hit.  I haven’t had so many stressors at once like that before. Last year I went to so many doctors (rheumatologist, neurologist, gynecologist, orthopedic surgeon, GP, cardiologist, pulmonologist). I had a chest X-ray, breathing  function test, 3 ECGs, heart ultrasound, 2 heart monitors for 7 days each, trans a final ultrasound, left breast ultrasound, thyroid ultrasound( few cysts not concerning), 5 blood tests different months always including CBC, Metabolic panel, Magnesium, glucose, thyroid, cholesterol, CRP, ESR, lipid, ANA, B12, B6, DHEAS, urine tests. 

I always worry about my heart even though I’m told I’m fine. I always check it when I walk around and get up from sitting etc. My resting can go down to the low 60s when it’s time for bed. When I sit it’s around 80s. 

I have been having so many symptoms since then and I still do. 

-skipped beat feelings every day(It happens randomly! I can have it during exercise, after exercise, when I eat, when at rest)

-high heart rate when I just get up from sitting walk around it’s in the 110s

-sensitive skin when I take my clothes off hard or rub my skin it’s just noticeable but not painful

-random quick head pains sometimes either side 

-tight upper back always cracks

-costcondritis left side tender always under left breast

I think he is having some IBS stuff.

Although work was/is a triggering event for his newly diagnosed anxiety, he doesn't feel that is what is keeping it going. In the past few years his dad got diagnosed with cancer, we had a child, he lost his job due to covid (out of control) to go to a temp. job for a year because of covid, now to having a good job again but now he is having anxiety which has prevented him from going to work some days lately.

Having anxiety myself i know things are easier said then done. Im wanting him to push foward instead of using PTO/sick time because i feel he has used A LOT of it already and its only FEB. Im starting to get really worried for him... and his job.

They havent said anything to him but i can imagine if this keeps going on something will be said. Hes explained things to his manager and his manager also has some anxiety issues so says he understands but also if this continues theres only so much the manager can help. 

He is on 10mg of lexapro since this started in JAN. and has made an apt for therapy through his works EAP but we are still waiting to get contacted by someone. He said his mind no longer races and heart no loner beats fast like it use to in the AM when he would wake up but still having the stomach stuff.

I says he doesnt feel depressed and from the outside looking in he doesn't seemed to be depressed. Seems like mostly anxiety triggered by all these past stressful events. Hes seen his doc and blood work has come back normal.

Ever since the lockdown in 2020 I've been extremely lonely and I mean EXTREMELY. Over the past two years ill say I've only kept and maintained one real friendship. Im thankful for just my one friend but just the one friend isn't fulfilling me socially. 

Now the reason I only have one friend and why I guess our friendship even works out its because of our similarities. Ive always been a little bit weird, but it seems after the lockdown where I was extremely isolated for a while its just gotten way worse. The high school kid I used to be with my handful of friends, confidence to go in public places, and overall better social skills is LONG gone...

&amp;#x200B;

2020 was a really isolated year for me but 2021 was literal hell (idk how I made it through) I went through a super depressed and isolated ""phase"" in my life from around June 2021 to Jan this year. When I say it was hell it was hell. Curveball after curveball. When I thought I seen my darkest day the moon would stop shining the next. 

 Heres the main things that really got me 

 •girlfriend cheated on me

 •Long time brother went behind my back and stole ($1000+) item from my car and pawned it

 •Since I was depressed got SUPER addicted to weed, dabbled in Percs, and nicotine

 •Fought through questioning my sexuality (mainly because people would say I ""looked"" or ""acted"" like it) 

• Got ashamed to show my face to anyone and would barely leave the bed for weeks

 • all of my high school ""brothers"" about 4-5 ghosted me and still don't talk to me 

And, all of this happened in a relatively short amount of time id say in a stretch of about 6 months. This caused me to question everything about myself... EVERYTHING. My sexuality, my confidence, and Sanity (I thought I was schitz or had some mental illness). Ever since I've just been attempting to recover because my depression and anxiety were at life time highs for months and not subsiding. 

Recently things have took and upturn for me though, thank god. I've quit smoking weed (2 months now) mainly because the paranoia was getting way out of hand (along wit the rest of the drugs). Ive gotten back into going to the gym frequently and started picking up some of the 20 pounds I lost during my ""phase"". My motivation for my work is coming back, and the biggest change I've made as of recently is change my diet to a healthy Keto diet. (only ate 1-2 a day, if I ate it was 99% of the time fast food or some comfort desert)

So, you can say I've made some great strides to recovering, but yet my anxiety (most days) is way to high now for me to go out in public, talk to friends, and be comfortable hanging out in a social environment. I can't talk to anyone smoothly (not even my Dad) I'm way to nervous and in my head all the time. My mind is racing thoughts of all my unproven insecurities like being mentally slow, gay, creepily weird, cross-eyed, crazy, and etc... 

I don't know what else I can do...I feel like I'm covering all bases besides maybe therapy (tried) &amp; medication (tried aswell with bad experiences). I just want to get back to the old me. 

I want to be able to hold a conversation without making a complete fool of myself.

 I want to feel true happiness again. 

I want to be able to make friends and enjoy my best years not cooped up in the house from anxiety. 

Im tired of battling anxiety I've been fighting my whole life... I though in high-school I was a anxious mess, but lord knows I never knew my anxiety and depression would get this bad. 

Im strong willed but I can't live my life like this...

My biggest trigger is being disliked/negatively judged/having someone disagree with me etc. It has caused me to be quite reserved with many of my opinions (especially political ones) because I fear the backlash. I don’t really know anyone else irl who has as much trouble with this as I do. 

Recently, I decided to get out of my comfort zone, and I voiced an opinion in response to a friend’s comment on one of my social media posts. The friend and I were both in agreement on the topic, for which I also presented some facts alongside my opinion. I knew I probably had others following me who would potentially see my statements and have a problem with them. Sure enough, the next day someone expressed their disagreement with me. I felt the familiar sting as my heart began to absolutely pound to the point where I swore I could hear it. My hands and underarms grew cold, sweaty. I started trembling. But within mere minutes I rattled off a short, factual, somewhat neutral toned reply, thinking, *They had a bit of an attitude and didn’t care about my feelings, so why should I take theirs into consideration? Don’t feel bad. You are right, after all.* 

It didn’t matter how confident I was in this argument and in the way I had answered. 


It didn’t matter how I knew a minor boat rocking like this wasn’t a big deal. 

I was a bit proud of myself for speaking up this time instead of deleting everything… but it still hurt like a bitch, and I still felt like I wanted to die. 

What we disagreed over is irrelevant to this post really— the point is, I want to know why am I like this? And how do I stop being like this? This sort of behavior on my part has made me extremely miserable throughout my life. I am so unbelievably tired of holding back because someone may have a retort at the ready. Not just for online arguments, but for anything where I may be negatively judged, including the things I wear and do. I have been thinking about this interaction ever since it happened and I just can’t let it go, which annoys others I have discussed (and continue to discuss) it with long after the fact. I figured I could practice on Reddit by making posts and comments, because I know a lot of people here ruthlessly don’t give two fucks.

I can't help but feel like I should've just let the page be stuck to the glued part and that now it's ruined and instantly devalued, if I tape it then the tape will become a permanent part of the book.

I thanked them and assumed there would be someone to speak with at the gate or somewhere in the parking ramp.

I had too much stress and anxiety to be able to add words to it at that stage. I'm now an EFT Practitioner, and I use it everyday for emotional self-care and health because of how beneficial it is for my well-being. 

Regarding your second question, the way we target different anxiety issues with EFT is to use precise and targeted words that best describe our experience of anxiety about a certain situation, not by tapping on any any particular point. Anxiety is often linked to worry and over-thinking, and it can also have physical manifestations (headaches, migraines, stomachs aches, neck pain etc). So you want to try and find the precise words to label your experience; that is what will be most beneficial for experiencing relief and shifts in your anxiety levels. 

For me personally, it wasn't until I did a tapping course for my own anxiety and stress levels 7 years ago that I actually understood how to tap in a way that was most beneficial, with words and all. That's when I learned about the importance of keeping track of the progress I was making by noting down  my anxiety numbers 0-10 for all the different issues I wanted to work on.  

I recommend keeping track of your progress in a tapping journal or in a file on your computer, so that you can see whether you are making progress. 

Have you tried making a playlist on YouTube of various free tapping for anxiety videos, to see if that could help you make a meaningful start to your tapping self-care practice?","t3_qxjdjj","t3_qxjdjj","anxiety","reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/qxjdjj/has_anyone_tried_eft_tapping/"

(Keep in mind, I have NEVER used illicit substances, and have no history of alcohol abuse)

For some context, I’m diagnosed with all anxiety disorders, and MDD.
I’m on a high dose of Zoloft to combat this, but due to the response only being partial, psychiatrist has added 100mg Seroquel (IR) at night which he claims is to augment the anti-anxiety effect of Zoloft. 
This causes me to doubt what his logic is. He is clearly avoiding minor-tranquillisers as my PRN, and on top of the 100mg Seroquel, he wants me to take 25mg as needed during the day when the anxiety demands it. 

The potential side effect profile of anti-psychotic medication is on par and arguably worse than benzodiazepines, and the current Seroquel dosage is a total joke to claim ‘Anti-anxiety’. He tries pushing his idea that it ‘increases’ Dopamine.

I wasn’t born yesterday, and I do my research. At this dose, all it’d be doing is acting as an antihistamine, and maybe an ever so slight balancing of SERT and DAT. Granted, the antihistamine effect can help a bit with being nervousness and agitated, but it’s offensive being told to take it for my chronic and crippling panic disorder. All it will do is cause strong sedation. My psychiatrist has over 15 years of experience and is a consultant psych, and this fact makes his prescribing behaviour even more unusual.","Psychiatrist Prescribing Questionable Medication (PLEASE HELP!!)","Advice Needed","hvp7jmh","winterstl","/r/Anxiety/comments/sl7tyy/psychiatrist_prescribing_questionable_medication/hvp7jmh/",1,1644070811,"Doctors avoid prescribing benzos due to risks of addiction","t3_sl7tyy","t3_sl7tyy","anxiety","reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/sl7tyy/psychiatrist_prescribing_questionable_medication/"

Second, I think you need to ask your self why having your plans cancelled triggers you. Your reactions do seem like trigger responses. In my opinion the cancellations hurt you because you see them as a rejection instead of circumstance. The pain is self inflicted because of your perceptions of the event, not the actual event itself. If you can accept that a cancellation is not a rejection then you will feel less pain when it happens. Additionally I would encourage you to make a list of all the times you were 'cancelled' to find the precipitating trauma that caused you to respond the way you do now to having plans change. Keep in mind a trauma does not have to be a profound event, it is an event that hurt YOU deeply enough to leave a trigger behind.

Hello all,

I've been trying my best to asses what happened to me a few days ago, that i ended up in the hospital. I was never diagnosed by anything. Basically, i've had a pretty normal life. Never had any traumas that left me scarred or stuff like that. Not saying im perfect, I do get anxiety from public speaking and im a bit claustrophobic, but my main issue or fear is getting attached to someone and them leaving me.

Around a week ago, All was good. I was sitting with at a mcdonalds, and suddenly felt a bit dizzy, and my hand went numb. Prior to it, i was so happy, and everything was amazing. So it made no sense to me. I brushed it off, and went to the gym, had a nice workout, went back home ate, showered, and then laid down on the ipad. Suddenly, i felt my leg go numb, and I started panicking. It felt get worse, and I got up, got dressed and went downstairs. I wasn't hyperventaliting, but i felt tired, and felt getting numb. I took a taxi to the hospital, and the second I got to the hospital, symptoms went away. I started to get better, but they still did tests, (ECG, blood tests, x-ray) all came back fine. I was sent home, and since then, I've been feeling okay, but a bit on edge trying to understand whats happening. Prior to that, I was soo happy, and life was great.

I started overanalyzing everything, and everything might maybe stress me a bit, but its small things, and nothing big enough to make me feel like this. However, one thing came to mind.

I have this thing where if i get attached to someone, and they leave me, I get anxiety and/or sad (pretty much mainly only romantic relationships) I had a best friend of 5 years break it off, and i was sad, but never like a girlfriend of 1 year leaving me. Over my 28 years of life, I had two girlfriends that i truly got attached too , and both ended up leaving me. Both times, I heartbroken, and it took a while for me to get over it.

Around 5 months ago, i met this amazing girl online, that at first, I didn't develop feelings for, but then after a week I did, and we planned that she will come visit me in march (next month) in hopes of getting together and get married. Things have been okay for the most part, but it has been a bit tough at times. Around 2 months back, we got into a big fight, and she wanted to break things off, and it was for the first time, I felt this kind of anxiety, and I had a breakdown, and sent her a long message apologizing, and hoping to work things out. I slept horrible that night, but we worked things out eventually, and that feeling was gone completely, and i was happier than ever. Since then, we had a few fights again, and it gave me the same sadness. We went around 2 days not talking at one point, and my entire thinking was about her, and i was extremely sad. However, everytime we work things out, that feeling just get sucked away. The day before I had that attack, she had disappeared for the whole day during a covo (she does that a lot, either she stops replying or just disappears until the next day). That whole day, i was feeling really sad, and then the next day, she comes back normal as if nothing has happened. While we were on the phone talking later that day, thats when I had that attack. Since then, i've realized that I got anxiety thinking about her or talking to her a couple of times.

(she has apologized for the fight we had a week or more prior to that, where she admitted to me that she was purposely trying to make her self the victim and make me feel bad. She opened up to me about her last relationship where her finance left her after keeping her stranded for 5 years for another woman. She promised that she is starting fresh and moving on.

So i'm trying to understand, is she the cause of this? can someone just help me understand a bit.","Trying to make sense of my panic/anxiety attack (first time I ever have it) 28 years old","Advice Needed","hvtrtor","UniqueUser912","/r/Anxiety/comments/sm06ve/trying_to_make_sense_of_my_panicanxiety_attack/hvtrtor/",1,1644164795,"I have had this happen to me years ago (losing sensation in the body).

I get nervous a lot randomly and when I do I have all these different signs. My stomach starts to hurt and it feels like there is air building in it. There are some points where it hurts so bad that I can’t focus on my whatever school work I am doing. I also tend to sweat a lot even when I don’t think I’m necessarily nervous. But when I am, I sweat a ton. Like my hands are always clammy and I refuse to wear any type of fitted tshirts because I just sweat through them. Also, whenever I do my schoolwork I start getting anxious and a really bad migraine comes in. It’s like one of those tension headaches. There are also times where I feel my throat close up and it’s hard to control my breathing. I also get really hot hot or cold at times when I’m nervous for no reason. It’s weird like my body gets super warm but my hands are freezing. I don’t know if that has anything to do with anxiety. Anyways, I also starting noticing that whenever I’m thinking or I get nervous about something I pick at my lips until they start bleeding or I bite the inside of my cheek. I also pick at my acne a lot, especially when doing homework. I also tend to overthink a lot and worry constantly about grades and my future what people think of me.

I suggest always having some type of protein w you, like beef jerky or a protein bar in your bag/car. The key to preventing blood sugar drops and the following jitters/anxiety isn’t to eat a LOT, it’s to eat foods that will sustain you and not cause a big crash.
Eating more often, but less food when you eat is also good. Like 5 mini-meals throughout the day instead of a few big ones. Maybe set a timer on your phone every two hours to have a snack or mini-meal, and maybe every hour to have half a glass of water? 
I’m sure your panic attack was from being jittery from lack of food, but I think the ones after we’re because you’re scared of panicking again, so you kind of conditioned yourself that pan licking can be prevented by eating.

"skdfj9","AnabellTheRebell","/r/Anxiety/comments/skdfj9/storytimequestionslong_crash_and_burncan_it_get/",1,1643981687,"I need to tell a little background story before I digg into the core of my problem. I hope you stay patient with me, and read it all.
I never thought I had to ask for advice in a forum as an adult woman in my 30's, but here I am. 

I used to be ""the ugly duckling"" growing up, and I was bullied alot. When I passed 25 things changed drastically. I lost a lot of weight and by the time I turned 30, I was better looking then I had ever been in my whole life. I had a lot of male friends for many years. It was easier, cause they spoked their minds and I always knew where I stood and what to expect from them. It was just easy and uncomplicated. 
When my looks changed, this became a huge problem. I couldn't have male friends anymore, cause no matter what i did, they ended up falling for me, and they got hurt. I hate hurting people.

I moved to the same street my mum lives in about 6 months ago. Prior to this I visited her now and then, and It came to my attention that the guys working at the pharmasy where she lives is very good looking. They run a family business, so most of the people working there, is family. When I came there before I moved, they were all nice and even on the edge to flirty sometimes. 

I have to go to the pharmacy 3 times a week due to a medical condition after several surgeries gone bad.(acute surgeries in my guts which has made my guts pretty toasted.) This pharmasy is the only pharmasy close to us. It's a long way to the next one. 

BACKGROUND TOLD, LET'S DIGG IN:

When I started to use the pharmasy as my regular go-to pharmasy, everything worked fine. They all acted nicely, but after they knew I moved, it was a little strange atmosphere when I was there. Two of them particularly  was acting very flirty. (I think they're brothers, but I'm not 100% sure.) I've started to be quite good to recognize flirting over the years. It was almost like a competition between these two for my attention when I came in. It's very hard to explain.
I'm flirty by nature, but I never put any ""game"" to it, if that makes sense. One of the guys started to stand out more and more, and I found him very attractive.  
I always thought it was very nice to go to the pharmasy, cause it always made me feel good walking out of there. It was a nice way to start my day. I miss those days.
One time, when I was at the counter with the one I found most attractive, -let's call him Moss, a good looking male family member my age came in and stood by me and talked to me.(they had never seen him before) Moss froze and started acting very weird and even had to leave the counter and give my order to someone else. He looked really shooken up. He walked to the back of the store where Noone could see him.
Moss always used my name several times every time he took my order. (My mum has used the pharmasy for years and knows the place very well. Better then me, but not once have I heard him say her name.)
The last month before the bad shit that happened, Moss was pretty much the only one taking my orders.

SO TO WHERE THINGS WHENT STRAIGHT TO H**L:

One night at home, I was having some anxiety, and I hadn't slept for days. I have this now and then, and usually just take a pill and go to sleep,and everything's better in the morning.
But I was out of my meds, so I asked my mum to borrow from her.(she also has anxiety now and then.)
She didn't have the one I used, but she had something similar. I was sleeping at my mums house that day.
I took the pill, and whent to sleep -or so I thought....
Next day when I ""woke up"" my mum told me that the pill had made me react very badly. Instead of getting tired and go to sleep, I got very energic and didn't sleep at all! She told me I had these weird ideas and I was just not myself at all. I found out that i had a 16 hour blackout window!!
I got really worried and checked my phone. Oh.my.God.. 
I had written so many texts that I would never in a million years write!!  I saw replies to things I would never ever talk about,say, or even think!
I started checking my apps and... yeah you guessed it.
I texted Moss.🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
I freaked out completely and only saw the first sentence of the message and that he had read it before I deleted it. I was in panic mode!!
The ony sentence I saw before deleting was: hey Moss! I hope you don't find this unapproapiate....
And that's it.
I wrote an apology to him saying I never ment to text him, and that I would try to avoid the pharmacy in the future. That I would never text him again.  I also told him I had a blackout due to reaction from an anxiety pill my mum gave me, and that I had no idea what I had written to him, and that I preferred to never know. I finished saying I hoped he some day could laugh of it and find it flatteting that I thought if him duing a blackout, but that I didn't mean to do this, and that I hoped we could just put it behind us.
He never responded to either texts, but he read them both.

I sendt my mum to the pharmasy the first week.
Then I got mad because he at least could have told me that it was nothing to worry about, and just stay professional, so I desided to go back, cause I knew I eventually had to. At the time I texted him I didn't know that the next pharmacy was that far away, but once I realised, I knew I just had to ""woman up"" and go back.

The first days I whent back was a fucking nightmare. I felt like All but 1 of them was avoiding me and not looking me in the eyes. I wasn't really looking much at them either tbh. I was just trying to cope with myself. I saw Moss the first couple days I was there but he was keeping a distance.
After this I didn't see him. Took me a while to realize that he was actually hiding!! Yes.. he was f*****g hiding. The way I realised this was that he was out on the floor in the pharmacy one time I came, but when he saw me he froze and ran to hide I'm the back of the pharmacy. 
This kept going for 2 weeks. I saw him run away several times.
I wish he'd just act like nothing happened but stayed professional.  It would have made things alot easier on me.
I'll admit that I was extremely uncomfortable going in, and it was probably written all over my face from day 1.
After 2 weeks I started to feal comfortable again cause I didn't really have to deal with him, and the others was acting nice again. Things whent back to normal ÷Moss.
But just as I started getting comfortable, the snake crawled out from hiding. He started circling around me, looking at me and glancing at me when I wasn't looking, but I could see it in the corner of my eyes. 
Then he started looking at Me when I looked at him, but only a few seconds before I looked away.
Them he started smiling at me, and I smiled back. After this, he said hi and smiled, and I did the same. 
So far so good. Right?
No.
I was freaking out a little every single time.
I wasn't ready to confront him or going to his counter.
After he ""came out from hiding, I had avoided it 3 times already. He was clearly trying to get me to his counter.(they were always 2 in the counters. If Moss had a customer but the other didn't, I whent straight to the one who didn't have a coustomer. When Moss didn't have a customer I walked around looking in the store before taking a ticket when i saw another customer go to Moss, and was called to the other counter etc. I was avoiding him cause I still felt so ashamed about the message.
I honestly thought about avoiding him for the rest of my life 🙈
3 days of avoidance and I was forced into a corner.
And that made me make a total idiot of myself. Again.
I didn't have a choise. 
I whent to the pharmacy to pick up my order, but Moss was the only one sitting in a counter. The other one stood a little behind him just observing the situation, but he had no intentions of helping me. 
They knew exactly the time I came, so it was easy to predict. (I always pick up my order at 9 am)
As I walked in I froze.  Just a little. I looked around, observing the situation, but Moss called out for me. He told me to come to his counter.
I didn't really have much of I choise without looking like an idiot.
I could feal my heart rising. I was fucking terrified!! But I desided that I needed to do this and just get it overwith. 
I walked up to him and started telling him what I was there to pick up, but my voice sounded so damn dry. My mouth was a desert and I could hear that he heard it. I was having a hard time to speak. He was smiling, but acting a little flirty but weird, while i was building up to a f****ng panick attack! In his counter!🤯
He was acting strange. I saw he was struggling aswell, just repeating exactly what I said over and over, not able to look at me for long at the time.  If that was because I was struggling or if he had his own issues I'm not sure.
My heart raised so fast. My mouth was dry. I started having big problems breathing. I got dizzy.. thoughts rasing through my head. I had to leave... I had to just tell him I couldn't do this and walk away. That - or faint on the floor of his store...😳
I swear he could hear this panic breathing. I turned away, just facing sideways with my face towards the exit, trying to get control of my betraying body.
It took about 2 minutes, and then I managed to remember to breath deeply and I managed to get control. I was able to act completely normally after this and smiled when I walked away, but I felt like a disaster. 
After ignoring him for weeks I got an anxiety attack infront of him!!? 
I've worked at moving on from making a fool out of myself only to make a fool out of myself🤦‍♀️

This is as far as this story goes. 

What I need help with is figuring out how to deal with this situation, with my anxiety, but also get some thoughts about what's going on in his head.
Cause I don't get it.
Why was he hiding??
Why is HE acting weird? 
Why was he unable to act professional?
And why us he struggling now? Is my bodylanguage enough to throw him off?
What's going on here??
It's damn comfusing and I just need this to be ok again so that I don't have to feal this bad every time I go there and for hours after. 

I appreciate any advice on how to handle myself and ideas you might have to why he's acting this way, cause it makes no sense to me.

Thank you for reading to the end!

I am a 22 y/o (m). And I likely have depression, though I haven't got a diagnosis yet. I have social anxiety too. Most of my peers in my age already have at least a year of job experience (at least part time) under their belt (just want to point out that highschool finishes a year later in my country and working before graduation isn't as common here as it is in the western world, but 1 year of part time work has become normal because most state universities don't take in students for about 1.5 years after they leave highschool). Most are also doing professional courses in parallel to the college studies. Some ditched state university for private campuses that started much earlier and are already doing their final year or interning.    
    
I am different to most of them in the sense that I wasted that 1.5 years after high school trying to sit for my a/l hoping for a better result, only to get disappointed and  applying with my 1st attempt's result in the end, and in the last 2 years I have pretty much done nothing worthwhile. While most batchmates did extra courses, did side gigs, invested in businesses, networked and beefed up their resume, I struggled to do the only coursework I attempted, and am likely to have to repeat an year because I did terribly in recent semester exams.   
   
I feel similar to how you described, like everyone is running a race and I am barely managing to crawl. Everytime I see someone announce a graduation, buying an own vehicle, heck, someone a year older than me is getting married! Meanwhile I don't even have a linkedin profile because there's is nothing to put there except my a/levels.

I have struggled with these kind of questions forever. It's like I am magically handicapped in some way. Everyone has an ambition, goals, are able to make connections and actually work towards their passion. Why can't I be like them? I know spending the whole day on reddit and youtube isn't healthy, and have constantly made attempts to become more outgoing, and active. But I am always the one to not get the memo on things, always the one not to have seen an opportunity and grabbed it. It's like I am always missing out on things.

This may have been asked before  but I can't phrase it in a way where I can find the answer I'm looking for. Like the title says, what I mean is if you feel anxious about x thing, say having forgotten your keys (multiple times a day even though you clearly remeber they are there) is it better to check and be like ""see they are there"" or is it worse as in like establishing a pattern where you only feel OK if you check ? The keys is just a simple example of a behaviour I have on many things big and small and I'm wondering if it helps more to ""give in"" and check or to fight off the urge. I spent the last day and half compulsively checking the stipend for a job I was offered in fear it wasn't what I understood, but no amount of checking (like with the keys) helps, so I had to email and ask, as so to have it written out in front of me to be more sure. I am still not 100% ""sure"", I have a meeting on Monday when that's going to be confirmed and until then I won't feel relaxed about it even though I already know that's it. I'm waiting for the ""eff you"" moment where something goes sideways. Anything I can do? Checking and or rationalising doesn't help in these cases.

The general thinking is that no, checking will increase and not decrease the desire to check in the future…. But it sounds like you’re figuring that out on your own. 

The kind of CBT I do would tell you that you don’t have to “fight off” the unpleasant feeling that makes you want to check on something. It’s ok to have that feeling. You can complain about it, write a song about it, feel it as deeply as you can. You don’t have to do anything to get rid of it, and in fact the things you’ve been using to get rid of it are making it worse and not better. You don’t have to do anything but have that feeling, which means you don’t actually have to check on anything.","t3_slzs4l","t3_slzs4l","anxiety","reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/slzs4l/should_you_give_in_to_your_anxious_need_to_check/"

I moved to the same street my mum lives in about 6 months ago. Prior to this I visited her now and then, and It came to my attention that the guys working at the pharmasy where she lives is very good looking. They run a family business. They were always nice and even on the edge to flirty sometimes. 
(I have to go to the pharmacy 3 times a week due to a medical condition after surgery gone bad. This pharmasy is the only pharmasy close to us. It's a long way to the next one.)

When I started to use the pharmasy as my regular go-to pharmasy, they all acted nice. But after they knew I moved, I recognized that two of them was flirting. (I think they're brothers, but I'm not 100% sure.) 
I'm flirty by nature, so I was just being myself. After some time one of the guys started to stand out more than the other.

One time, when I was at the counter with the one I found most attractive, -let's call him Moss, a good looking male family member my age came in and stood by me and talked to me.(they had never seen him before) Moss froze and started acting weird and had to leave the counter and give my order to someone else. He looked really shooken up. He walked to the back of the store where noone could see him.
Moss always used my name several times every time he took my order. He winked, smiled and leaned over to my counter if someone else was taking my order. -basically just finding any chanse to talk to me.
The last month before the bad shit that happened, Moss was pretty much the only one taking my order.

SO TO WHERE THINGS WHENT WRONG:
One night at home, I was having anxiety, (which I have now and then.) I hadn't slept for days. 
I was out of my meds, so I asked my mum to borrow a pill from her,since she also have some anxiety.
She didn't have the one I used, but she had something similar. 
I took the pill, and whent to bed.
Next day when I ""woke up"" my mum told me that the pill had made me react very badly. Instead of getting tired and go to sleep, I got energic and didn't sleep. She told me I had these weird ideas and I was just not myself at all. I found out that i had a 16 hour blackout window!!
I got really worried and checked my phone. Oh.my.God.. 
I had written so many texts that I would never in a million years write!!  
I started checking my apps and... yeah you guessed it.
I texted Moss.🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
I freaked out completely and only saw the first sentence of the message before I deleted it in pure panic. 
The ony sentence I saw before deleting was: hey Moss! I hope it's OK that I'm reaching out to you....
That's it.
I wrote an apology to him saying I never ment to text him, and that I would try to avoid the pharmacy in the future, that I didn't mean what I said, and that I would never text him again. I also told him I had a blackout due to reaction from an anxiety pill my mum gave me, that I had no idea what I had written to him. I finished saying I hoped we one day could laugh of this. He never responded to either texts, but he read them both.

I sendt my mum to the pharmasy the first week.
Then I got mad because he could have told me that it was ok, and be professional, so I desided to go back, cause I knew I eventually had to.

The first days I whent back was a nightmare. I felt like All but 1 of them was avoiding me and not looking me in the eyes. I wasn't really looking much at them either tbh. I was just trying to cope. I saw Moss the first couple days but he kept a distance.
After this I didn't see him. Took me a while to realize that he was actually hiding!! Yes.. he was f*****g hiding. I realised this when I saw him out on the floor in the pharmacy one time I came, but when he saw me he froze and ran to hide I'm the back. 
This kept going for 2 weeks. I saw him run away several times. After a while I grew comfortable with this since I didn't have to deal with Moss.

(In the beginning I was extremely uncomfortable, and it was probably written all over my face from day 1.)

Just as I started getting comfortable, the snake crawled out from hiding. He started circling around me, looking at me and glancing at me when I wasn't looking, but I could see it in the corner of my eye. 
Then he started looking at Me when I looked at him, but only a few seconds before looking away..
Then he started smiling at me, and I smiled back. After this, he said hi and smiled, and I did the same. 
So far so good. Right?
No.
I was freaking out a little more every single time.
I wasn't ready to confront him.
He was trying to get me to his counter, and I successfully managed to dodge it 3 times.(they were always 2 in the counters. If Moss had a customer but the other didn't, I whent straight to the one who didn't have a coustomer. When Moss didn't have a customer I walked around looking in the store before taking a ticket when i saw another customer go to Moss, and was called to the other counter etc.) 
I honestly thought about avoiding him for the rest of my life 🤷‍♀️

The 4th time I was forced into a corner.
I whent to the pharmacy to pick up my order, but Moss was the only one sitting in a counter. The other one stood a little behind him just observing the situation, but I saw that he had no intentions of helping me. 
They knew exactly the time I came, so it was easy to predict since I always go there around 9 am.
As I walked in I froze.  Just a little. I looked around, observing the situation, but Moss called out for me. He told me to come to his counter.
I knew I didn't  have much of I choise without looking like an idiot, so I desided to go.
I was terrified!! My heart was about to explode.I wanted to run but at the same time get it overwith.

I walked up to him and started telling him what I was there to pick up, but my voice sounded so damn dry. My mouth was a desert and I could hear that he heard it. I was having a hard time to speak. He was smiling, but acting a little flirty but weird, while i was building up to a freaking anxiety attack in his counter!!🤯
He was acting strange. I was acting strange. I saw that he was struggling, and he just kept repeating exactly what I said over and over again, not able to look at me for long at the time.  If that was because I was struggling or if he had his own issues I'm not sure.
I started having big problems breathing. I got dizzy.. thoughts rasing through my head. I had to leave... I had to just tell him I couldn't do this and walk away. That - or faint on the floor of his store...😳
I swear he could hear this panic breathing. I turned sideways, with my face towards the exit, trying to get control of my betraying body.
It took about 2 minutes, and then I managed to remember to breath deeply and get control. I was able to act completely normally after this and smiled when I walked away, but I felt like a disaster. 
After ignoring him for weeks I got an anxiety attack infront of him!!? 

How do I deal with this situation? Why is he acting this way? and will this keep happening to me? Anxiety attacks every time I have to face him? or does it get easier?

It’s also stronger depending who it is. If an old guy comes up and starts working out next to me I likely won’t be too bothered.

1. Is the term of overidentification. This is when one's sense of self is overcome with emotions, typically negative emotions, and you can't step outside of these yourself. The emotion becomes your identification and you think this is who you are. This happens to me sometimes. One thing that helps me is to think about mindfulness. You can recognize the emotion, you can feel it, you can see it. Now recognize that its there, try to hold it in your mind and manipulate it a bit. You control the emotion now, it doesnt control you. Tell yourself this emotion doesnt control you anymore, you see it its not making you feel better so you are going to cast it aside now. It had its turn.
2. It sounds like you are ruminating on something. You keep coming back to the same thing or feeling and cant get past this. Its cyclical. Anyway you cut it your mind comes darting back to the negative feeling. I would see if you can face your emotion head on and figure out exactly what caused your panic attacks in the first place.

Possible Trigger Warning? I’m not sure if this is an accurate representation of anxiety. To preface I recently got promoted and I messed up big time at work when dealing with a coworker acting out. All the other guys in my section saw firsthand how I failed to handle the situation.

After the event, I immediately talked to my mentor on how I could’ve handled the situation better and what to do going forward. This helped with the stress to some degree. Looking back it probably isn’t as big a deal as I’m making it out to be but I was stressing hardcore over the whole ordeal.

I tried the normal methods of dealing with the stress I’m used to by going to the gym and smoking but surprisingly these methods just heightened the anxiety. I think at this point I panicked because my go to routine was failing and was instead increasing my anxiety. I was struggling to breathe normally and I immediately called my family and close friends which definitely helped. My breathing got better but it was still irregular.

At first I didn't even realize it was my anxiety making me like this, but today I was just wondering why I was being so lazy and doing absolutely everything in my power to avoid leaving the house. For the past week I have avoided running into my flatmates, attending my lectures in person, going grocery shopping (because I ran out of almost all my food and have been living off of microwaveable popcorn), and so on. There are so many other things I need to be doing like studying and cleaning my room but my mind is so scrambled right now and I'm so exhausted that I just never get anything done. 

My other issue is sleep. I have essentially become nocturnal because my body is either too worked up because of my anxiety to let me sleep during nighttime or I actively avoid sleeping because I get horrible nightmares/sleep paralysis/hallucinations (I have narcolepsy). This causes me to only fall asleep when I'm at the actual point of exhaustion. It also sucks because I get super paranoid at night. My anxiety actually gets worse because I have this irrational fear that somebody is watching/stalking or that something terrible is going to happen to me.

I'm starting to be super restless and weirdly sometimes hyperactive, but not in a productive way. More like in a I can't control my body type of way. 

Please if anyone has advice on what steps I can take to managing my anxiety (i beg you please do not suggest meditation or yoga) and how to sleep despite anxiety that would be incredible. Also side note, I know people are probably gonna suggest seeing a therapist and/or psychiatrist about my condition, which I am planning on doing, but for now I just need some advice on how to get a little better because there is no way I could talk to someone with how severe my social anxiety is right now.

After my SO’s father’s passing, a lot of my anxiety went away and my GP and I agreed that I could wean off and stop Buspar. She advised that my anxiety as of late appears to be “situational anxiety” (certain scenarios make my GAD much worse or accelerates symptoms) and recommended I keep my remaining Buspar on hand instead of tossing it. 

The past 3 weeks, I have been experiencing severe anxiety symptoms to the point where I took a day off work because I could not stop shaking or crying (I have rarely taken time off work for anxiety). I hate admitting when my anxiety is beating me and I don’t want to turn to meds again but I don’t feel i have any other choice.

Some days towards nighttime I also just start feeling too good and energetic which causes me to want to make this opportunity useful to be productive and work on things such as projects.

My situation is that I’m in a new area and have become quite anxious about going outside, since it gets dark quickly. It’s normal to be cautious when going out alone at night, but when “night” is 6pm and the anxiety is debilitating that’s a problem. Another example is being fearful of a house fire. That’s a normal thing to be mindful of, but when it causes me to check the stove over and over and worry about it while I’m outside, it negatively impacts my life. These are some clear examples, but things can get fuzzy in any area and be less obvious.

They feel horrible and scary, but something has triggered your brain to send adrenaline and redirect your blood and energy to your muscles. Sometimes it's makes you breathe harder, and go faint or dizzy and your chest hurts. 

Something my therapist has unapologetically drummed into me is how i.portant and helpful it is just to understand the fight / flight response.

I'm a 15 year old boy and for the past 2 year I've been thinking I have anxiety.

My mother is diagnosed with anxiety and depression and I've been talking to her about how I feel since it's hereditary. 

(I love my mother I can be so open with her she makes me feel so comfortable with my feelings but I don't talk so much to not worry her)

I am able to people to big groups of people and be myself really easily I actually love talking to big groups and making jokes, telling story's, like stand up comedy. But I always noticed that Everytime I do it I still get these feelings. My feet start curing up so much to where my feet start hurting or I keep spreading my toes. I clench my fist as hard as I can or squeeze my hand as hard as I can together or keep rubbing my arms and hands or playing with any item I can hold. My heart start beating really fast and my breathing picks up and I feel like going to cry. And I wished I didn't feel like this cus if I didn't than maybe I could actually try to do real stand up comedy. 

When I'm by myself and I think of stressful stuff I start to again curl my toes, things with my hands, and heart rate goes up. I start to get really mad and sad cus I hate that feeling, it's the worst feeling in the world like nothing good is going to ever happen and I want to cry. Something I do to calm down is to call a friend or play guitar. Other times I just blank out when it becomes to much. I let go of my muscles and let my brain become empty and I try to look around and see the fine details in stuff and it helps for that moment. 

When I send simple email to teacher like ""how can I be able to take calculus as a senior"" and I get a response I get so worried that I need to build up the courage to open it cus I feel I asked something wrong.

I thought having anxiety is worrying about things like the future and I thought oh that I don't worry about the future untill I realized that the reason I don't worry about the future is cus I don't think about the future at all cus I hate it. It makes me sick I just want to worry about right now not tomorrow. So I just don't care and I feel that's bad. Something else that helps me is weed. Weed always calmed me down and gave me even more confidence to say things to people or just do things. I would say still and feel like everything is going to be fine. But I don't want to do weed since I could hurt me when I'm older I read and also my friends worry about me doing weed and don't want me too so I've been not doing it. 

Normally when I'm not talking to anyone like if I'm in class I get feelings that people are looking at me or that I'm doing something wrong and my heart rate feel liked it going up and and down and up and down.

I feel like I'm in denial of having anxiety because I don't want to have it everytime I think might have it makes my chest hurt and all the feelings start happening.","Do I have anxiety?

A bit of background about me, without meaning to come across as egotistical, I used to be the type of person that people enjoyed being around. Friends’ parents loved me as I was kind, helpful and good to talk to. I used to be funny, quick witted and positive. I was the agony aunt for all those around me and I loved giving advice because i was good at it and i knew it helped people. I was emotionally intelligent and empathetic in a way that allowed me to truly understand people but not let it affect myself- so I could be strong for those around me too. For about a year now I have been suffering with anxiety that has really challenged my self perception and has made me question every move, every word and every thought I have. I even applied to be a university Samaritan (someone who talks to those who may be struggling and need an ear to listen to) but I had to drop out because I felt I couldnt even touch the surface of my own problems anymore never mind anyone else’s. I often feel like I have no thoughts other than worrying intensely about how I am perceived and grieving for the me I used to know, I really liked her. I now feel I am turning into a bad person as I do not have the ability to perceive my actions from an objective POV and instead am so consumed by everything that I do and how I feel about myself. Even the good things I try to do for others somehow has a selfish slant by me trying to be the willing and giving me I used to know. I don’t want to even be involved in anything anymore, I don’t want any expectations or to be around those that I love or care about as It just reinforces how inadequate I feel I am. I just don’t care anymore and I don’t know how to get back from this. I try to speak to people about it but then start to feel guilty and stupid for talking about it as I usually am very good with dealing with my problems and feel I am excusing my behaviour (often quiet and standoffish or being too over the top to try to compensate for being boring now- often it doesn’t come across right as my actions are so calculated so I often end up feeling worse than if I just stayed quiet). I don’t know if this made any sense but any advice would be really great, I hope there is an end to all of this and if anyone has any tips I would appreciate it so much.

23 f. Ended up in A&amp;E (emergency room) about 5 days ago because of chest pains that I have been having for so long but they just got worse and more frequent (sharp, stabbing, can be burning) so basically I got to the hospital and from walking up to the reception which was like 2 mins I’d say I had only walked my heart was beating so fast and I got this weird feeling in my chest as if it was burning, you know when you have like ran really hard doing exercise and it goes into your throat that feeling ? I told them how I was feeling and they brought me straight in after my heart rate went to 170bpm. My heart rate started to go down after about a minute or 2 and went down to I’d say about 100bpm maybe and as it was slowing down it started skipping beats. Long story short I had 2 ECGS, a chest X-ray, bloods, oxygen levels and blood pressure were perfect. A doctor said to me it’s still odd how your heart rate is still a little high (104bpm) and I was just sitting down. I told her I suffer massively with anxiety and panic attacks but the last few months the symptoms have gotten worse and more frequent and we both concluded I could have POTS as my heart rate goes back down to normal when I lie down. Said I need to go about get a holter monitor done. My own doctor (PCP) noticed my heart rate was a bit high when he took my blood pressure when standing a couple of months ago and said oh that could be just anxiety. I have daily symptoms everyday:

• Vertigo/dizziness - suspected inner ear problem from my doctors as I have minor hearing loss in my right ear. 
• Ringing in ears.
• Visual snow - my vision looks static and is worse at night. That is 24/7. Throughout the day I will see black dots that flash for like 1 or 2 seconds, they can be colourful aswell. Also see floaters. 
• Palpitations - flutters mainly after eating, races when I move around and walk. Also sometimes skip when my heart goes very fast and I crouch down or something. Sometimes burping relives palps.
• Chest pains - can be sharp that last for 2 seconds where my heart is on the left side, right side, sternum, etc. 
• GERD/acid reflux symptoms. 
• Headaches. When changing position or moving head it pounds. 
• Pains in arms, legs, back, neck, jaw. 

What is scaring me the most is that my heart rate goes so fast when I walk for like a minute or two outside like when it did when I went up to the hospital that has happened numerous of occasions the last few months and it scares me thinking I have a heart problem. I’m completely bedridden with all of these symptoms the dizziness and the palpitations are the worst and most people and doctors keep telling me it’s purely anxiety but it feels so much more than that.

Tldr:  I am the mother of a 10 year old with pretty significant GAD. My question is, does your generalized anxiety disorder affect your executive function?

Backstory: I thought my kiddo was showing signs of adhd. I had her evaluated by a licensed psychologist, and was told that she has pretty significant GAD. And coordination disorders called to dyspraxia and dysgraphia.  She has since started counseling and occupational therapy it's going pretty well. One of her... I guess symptoms... Is that, when she's feeling anxious, she gets really snappy, short, and curt with people. We have discovered that it is because she struggles with executive dysfunction. Basically she is so anxious that she doesn't know what to do first, and this causes her to feel like she's backed in a corner and she needs to fight her way out. One of the reasons I thought she might have ADHD was because she can't seem to focus, but her therapist said that it's not that she can't focus on one thing, it's that she doesn't know where to begin and she gets overwhelmed. Does this happen with anybody else? How do you deal with it? Any tricks I can try with her?  I just want to be a source of calm for her.","help a mom out?","Advice Needed","hw6i49n","Mama_Bear-Love","/r/Anxiety/comments/so37k0/help_a_mom_out/hw6i49n/",1,1644378921,"My daughter is 12 and also experiencing similar issues. We expect a diagnosis of anxiety (generalized or social) but she is currently diagnosed MDD (depression). It is very common for these to overlap/have similar symptoms.

At home she has a sensory/safe space she can utilize when feeling too overwhelmed. However I do encourage her to use in the moment coping strategies before resorting to this. 

My daughter keeps a note book and writes down what triggers her anxiety in the moment; is it noise? too many people? school work? feeling overwhelmed? hungry?
Once we can identify what her triggers are, we can expect and adapt for her. 

One thing that has been very important for her is working on emotional regulation and breathing when she is stressed. It also helps for that anxious ""fight"" energy to have some form of appropriate outlet in the moment; try her with a few fidget toys. Once you know the specific cause there are some other things that can be done too. My daughter gets snappy when she is overwhelmed or there is too much noise, so we break down tasks (instead of clean your room; pick up clothes, done? put books in a pile, put books on shelf, find all your soft toys ect...)  and reduce noise in our home. I'm waiting on some noise reducing headphones for out of home.

At school she becomes TOO overwhelmed by class settings and doesn't have the skill set to deal with it, so we are placing her in the Learning Center for this year as a gentler variation. She has the ability to break from work and use coping strategies including mental wellness worksheets and coloring books. She also keeps fidgets with her for school. 

Some of my favorite exercises to do with her are: Vader breathing/Ujjayi breath (Google videos!), 5-5-5 Grounding (5 things I see, feel, smell), Heart control; place a hand on your chest if your heart is racing and see if you can make it beat slower with breathing. Finger counting; take your thumb and tap each finger. You can make patterns and have her focus on copying your taps herself if it helps her. 

I'd also recommend seeing if you can get her in a yoga class!","t3_so37k0","t3_so37k0","anxiety","reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/so37k0/help_a_mom_out/"

The best thing I’ve found is to use the Pomodoro method, where you set a timer for work time, and then afterwards set a timer for break time. For more stressful topics, you can add more break time, for easier topics you add more work time. 

I usually try and do 40 minutes of work time to 5 minutes of break time for easy topics.

I’ll do 25 minutes of work time to 10 minutes of break time for more intermediate topics.

Ill do 15 minutes of work time to 20 minutes of break time for stressful topics.

Your goal in this isn’t to work as fast as you can. Rather it’s to progress at a pace that is consistent and doable for you.

Make notes of your progress after each session to ensure you will meet your deadlines, and commend yourself each step of the way, especially in the face of difficulty or slow progress. 

It doesn’t matter how long it takes you to arrive at your goal as long as you can meet your deadlines.

Start projects early with a clear plan and give yourself some wiggle room. There will be unanticipated hiccups and accounting for these early on makes them less stressful. 

You can do this.","t3_sojpwy","t3_sojpwy","anxiety","reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/sojpwy/stuck_in_an_anxiety_and_procrastination_loop/"

I planed a trip to Cabo with some friends a while ago and have just been waiting to see how COVID is going to make the final decision about whether or not to go. With Omicron dying down recently I've been set on going, until I realized that you have to show proof of a negative test to get back into the US. Should have realized this before, but again I kind of only recently decided I was actually going and started looking into travel restrictions.

It's not that I'm so anxious about getting super sick. I'm triple vaxxed and I want to go about living my life. If I get sick then I get sick. What I AM worried about is testing positive and then being stuck in Mexico for who knows how long. I know a number of people who were triple vaxxed and still got COVID and didn't test negative for a week or so. I was only planning to take 3 days off work for this trip and since I've been recently promoted it would be really stressful for me to have a miss a lot more unexpectedly. I also have a jiu jitsu competition I've been working really hard for the weekend following the trip.

I talked to my friends about it and they're not very concerned. Two of them are teachers who have the whole week off and one goes to school remotely, so I think that gives them more leeway. To me it just feels like a big risk and I think I could have a hard time enjoying the trip knowing that I'll have to test at the end and not knowing what the results will be. For that reason, I'm leaning towards not going. I'm worried though that my anxiety is getting in the way of what could be a really fun trip with friends I don't see that often and I'm afraid of missing out.

Do you have an existing prescription for meds? If so, go on [www.Goodrx.com](https://www.Goodrx.com) and look for coupons. Xanax, for example, is $10/month. A lot of drug makers also have coupons on their websites.

If you do not have an existing prescription, then you need affordable health care. You can look for low-cost clinics to start. You can try calling a former doctor and telling them that you have a crisis and ask for a prescription. You never know. 

Obviously, apply for jobs so you can get some cashflow. even if it is not the money you want (or need) to make, something is better than nothing and can help you get meds and start to prioritize your survival needs.

Don't worry about the debts for now. Even though they're a black cloud over you, all debts collectors can do is harass you. They'll get the money when they get it--if they get it.

Even if it doesn't work first try, you can just try a slightly higher dose every couple of months until you find the dose that works.

Second option - do some research on 'cognitive behavioural therapy'. This is an actual system of treating anxiety, not just random stuff like 'try meditation' or 'try journaling'.

For... many reasons I've (20F) come to realize that my anxiety levels are getting progressively worse. It's to a point now where it's starting to take a pretty big toll on my normal functioning and I'm scared because I know it's only going to get worse as the semester progresses.

I've realized that, as much as I don't want to, the best way out of this is to reach out and actually do something. The only problem is I don't exactly have a history of doing well with receiving help. Dealing with counselors and doctors is incredibly overwhelming for me. I was prescribed lexapro about 2 years ago and it worked well but I ended up weaning myself off of it (I know, I know) after less than a year because both of the docs I dealt with were very rude and condescending and the thought of consistently interacting with them was too much for me to handle.

Pretty much all my interactions with counselors have been dismissive. The last time I tried counseling I was probably in one of the darkest spots of my entire life... and what did the counselor do? Tell me she didn't believe I could possibly have anxiety or be depressed because I was able to hold a normal conversation with her, followed by the classic ""Have you tried meditation or exercising more?"".

I would talk about it more with friends or my bf but that's not exactly something that comes naturally or easily to me. I don't like having other people worry about me or feel as though they have to take care of me. I don't know if they'd even fully believe me because I never really talk about things like this. The last few times I've opened up about things to people in my life it gets to be too much for me to handle and I've left the conversations feeling worse than when they started because of the guilt. It doesn't help that I grew up in an environment where negative emotions were never really acknowledged or validated, and would often be punished for my anxiety related behaviors. I'm used to just solving problems on my own, even though I do realize that's not always a good option.

A few weeks ago I tried to book an online mental health consult to get back on medication but I ended up canceling because I was getting near-debilitating anxiety at the thought of talking to another healthcare professional about my situation. Plus after my irresponsible history with medication I'm worried a doctor won't want to prescribe me anything (rightly so tbh).

With that being said... sometimes I feel like I'm beyond the point of being able to recieve help. Does anyone have suggestions for ways to start to reach out and get professional help in the least anxiety-inducing way possible? Ideally the tiniest baby step at first?","How to start getting help without getting overwhelmed?","Advice Needed","hwgdf5m","[deleted]","/r/Anxiety/comments/spnyjp/how_to_start_getting_help_without_getting/hwgdf5m/",1,1644547473,"Treat this like you would a broken leg.

Since the age of 14, it has grown worse. I've tried every type of medication, and I'm currently taking Klonopin and Lamictal. I see a therapist and psychiatrist. I talk to friends and my dad every day. Because of my mental health, I am unable to hold a 9-5 job. On the side, I do background commercials but may have to quit because I feel as though my body is shutting down. Smoking weed helped me a lot until it didn't anymore. Several months after my mom died from undiagnosed cancer, I began experiencing terrible back pain, shoulder pain, and crippling knee pain. I thought it was a sprain but it was nerve pain. Neither weed nor CBD helped. I can barely leave the house now. My symptoms include dizziness, muscle pain, nausea, twitching, spasms, low blood sugar, agoraphobia, cramping, genetic hair loss, neck pain, stomach issues, sound sensitivity, nauseous, and chronic fatigue, and I can't control them. It is so bad that the only thing that helps is sleeping it off, which is not a very good quality of life. Occasionally, I don't even feel anxious when I need to rest or have some quiet time. Even though I used to do all these things like party and hang out with friends before, I still had anxiety, but now I have the same anxiety and cannot function due to my health issues. What is the point in living like this? Because I'm in so much pain, I have to stay home and isolate myself. Nothing works and no one understands. My only medical diagnosis is PCOS, and I'm due for some MRIs on my neck and spine. Let's hope this is simply anxiety. There were elevated B-12 levels in my blood, and I do not take any supplements which can lead to symptoms like this.

I have a great aunt with schizophrenia, and I have done psychedelics a few times as a teenager, so I began obsessing over those facts and fearing that my life is going to be ruined from getting schizophrenia, and I ended up having a pretty massive panic attack, the first one I've ever had really. I experienced pretty bad anxiety as a kid during my parents divorce, but I haven't really felt it in many years, and haven't considered myself an anxious person for a while, besides some hypochondria about cuts leaving scares, and worrying about getting carpal tunnel syndrome or tendonitis, and not being able to play the guitar anymore. Now I'm over covid, but I still feel this worry that I'm descending into physcosis. I usually feel pretty fine when I'm occupied with a task, or interacting with friends, but when I'm left alone with my thoughts, the worry of schizophrenia pops up, and then I begin thinking that the little shadows I catch moving out of the are the beginnings of a hallucination that will mark my true demise, and that at any moment, I could experience a breakdown, and my life will be ruined. Even as I'm writing this, I'm worried that I'm writing it in a way that is designed to convey more symptoms of anxiety than schizophrenia, because that's the preferable answer.

* Therapy (CBT, DBT, Psychodynamic, ACT, 20+ therapists)
* Psychiatric Hospitalization (2 months)
* Support Groups (10+)
* Ketmamie (10 IV infusions)
* Psylocibin (2x, made it way worse)
* Acupuncture (many treatments)
* Witchcraft
* Spirituality (religion, prayer, paganism, etc)
* Philosophy
* Trauma &amp; Inner child work, completion process, etc.
* Meditation
* Proven Supplements (vitamins, B12, fish oil, etc)
* Medication (Effexor, Zoloft, Lexapro, Gabapentin, Xanax, Adavan, Wellbutrin, Vyvanse, Adderall, Buspirone etc.) (all had 0 effect except the stimulants)
* Exercise (helps a bit)
* Fasting
* Various diets (keto, paleo, vegan, etc.)
* Digital Detox
* Hypnotherapy

I have tried all the ""10 ways to destress"" stuff like taking a bath and walking in nature, and every grounding technique I've ever heard. Alcohol is a nice bandaid fix that works if I'm not already flipping out, but I can't do it more than once a week or I get anxious about the health effects. I don't do weed or anything else recreationally, it makes me feel awful, I only do drugs medicinally with a guide or nurse in a legal manner.

HAVE NOT TRIED

* Chinese Medicine
* MDMA/Ecstasy
* DMT
* LSD
* Toad Venom
* Ayahuasca
* Join a cult for the community aspect
* Become a sex slave so I have greater priorities
* ECT - Electroshock therapy
* TMS - Transcrancial Magnetic Stimulation
* Vagus Nerve Stim
* Self Harm
* Herbal supplements
* Integrative Family Systems therapy
* Art therapy

Not super interested in the stuff like alternative medicine and ECT/Vagus because of the invasiveness and health concerns. Also most of that stuff is for depression, which is not my primary concern, it's the healthh anxiety. If I am just depressed, I can force myself to do things once or twice a week, but when anxious I'm almost completely paralyzed with fear. 

Could anyone suggest something else to try? Like really unique stuff I've never heard of? I don't \*want\* to be hopeless, but after so much work, everything I try that fails just sends me into despair. And believe me, I've tried doing nothing too. 

Please don't insult me in the comments and tell me I'm not trying hard enough or expecting an easy fix, that's usually the reaction I get.","A list of Everything I've tried and everything I haven't.

That went away but I am still in constant brain fog feeling where I don’t feel real, I feel dizzy, like I’m gonna fall over, and it just doesn’t stop. I’ve already been to the doctor to see if I have an issue with my ears and my vestibular balance system, nothing was wrong. So now I have to get blood work done just to make sure that it isn’t a health issue. I do think it’s anxiety just because if I distract myself enough the feeling goes away until I remember that I’m supposed to be feeling it and then it comes back. But it’s debilitating.

I have this extreme fear of passing out or having a seizure. So this feeling makes me feel like I am about to have both of those things, though I never have. You would think that that would ease my mind with the amount of times I felt this feeling and nothing has happened, but every time I worry that that moment is going to be the moment where something happens. And it just continues. It’s affecting my life it’s affecting my job I’m literally sitting here thinking about quitting because I haven’t been to work in almost 3 weeks due to this feeling. My job is a great job, it’s full-time, has amazing benefits and decent pay. I can’t afford to lose it but I’m afraid. I do have a slight worry that it is a neurological issue but I don’t know. Today while I was typing, I forgot how to spell the word white and it scared me a lot because I’ve never been that clueless on how to spell such a simple word, so it sent me into an even bigger brain fog attack.

So I've been thinking recently about my life, about how I became the way that I am.
I've been socially anxious and depressed for a long time, I struggle to make friends or even connect with people, despite meeting alot of new people regularly. 
I've been thinking about how I used to be as a kid... It wasn't this hard back then and I used to be way more trusting, optimistic and open with people. 
So what changed? 
Oh yeah, I immigrated to America as a child.

I'm not sure if this is the only reason why I have social anxiety, I believe it's a combination of this and other things, like moving from one city to another and having to rebuild my friend circle over and over again from the beginning. It just becomes exhausting at some point you know? 
I just wish to change and have stable, healthy friendships one day.

This feels like a lifelong death sentence. And the worst part about this is that,all this seems like it's coming out from the mouth of a mad person.. Maybe it's the demon inside me speaking. If this is how other people like me feel.. Then this world of God is a failed project.

Okay so to start off, I'm a 20 year old girl and have been at this job for about 4 months. 

I have SA and idk why but it's always been wayyy worse around guys. Like it's silly I know but unless they are family, I just feel so on guard and uncomfortable around them. I've never had guy friends. My friends have always been girls. 

So at my work place all the servers are girls but the people who make the food are all guys. So I don't really interact with them all that often cos they are out the back cooking, but sometimes you have to go out there to get stuff. So I say hi to them and stuff but nothing else. I am so embarrassed to say this because now after what happened I feel like a total idiot, but I thought one of them was cute (let's call him B) because he would always say hi to me and was the only one who was nice to me, I.e. if he saw me looking for something he would ask what I was looking for and tell me where it was, or one time I was taking shit out of the oven but I put way too much stuff on and almost burned myself so he asked if I needed help and helped me out, which I really appreciated cause I legit felt like I was gonna have a panic attack and start crying cos I was afraid of burning myself.

Anyways this is where stuff starts happening that makes me feel like I'm being bullied, like there's definitely not a ""friendly banter vibe"" more of an ""intimidation vibe"" to all this. But I wanted to share as maybe this is just my SA putting everything in a negative perspective? 


Okay so the first instance happened a few weeks ago. I was again taking stuff out of the oven to put in the shop and one of the guys (let's call him S) comes over to me, sort of lifts his shirt up to fan himself and then he goes ""sorry (my name) it's just it's pretty hot in here isn't it?"" And I was kind of confused as to why he was talking to me so I was like ""yeah the ovens are pretty hot?"" And then he goes ""and it's not just cause B is in here"". And I felt so fucking mortified when he said that cause B was in the room and also I was like how does he know?! But I just didn't look at him or respond and kept doing the task at hand. And then he's still standing there staring at me, so he's like ""B is a pretty attractive guy isn't he?"" And again I don't say anything cause this is literally the most embarrassing moment of my life. And then after a few seconds he starts pissing himself laughing to the other guys and said something like ""she didn't say anything!!"" The rest of that shift my anxiety was so high, I felt so embarrassed and was on the verge of tears the whole time and as soon as I left and got in my car I just started crying the drive home thinking about how I wanted to quit my job cause of how mortifying that was. I told my friends and they said this guy is a dickhead and I shouldn't let him get to me. 

So I go back to work like 2 days later and I just act as if nothing has happened. 

Okay so I fucking hate S because of what he did, like that was so fucking embarrassing, mortifying and honestly childish. I wish I could punch him in his face. And I think ordinarily I would stand up for myself and be like ""fuck off"" but because it's in the workplace I feel really uncomfortable about doing that, like I have to be professional because I am getting paid to do a job. 

So for a few weeks nothing like that happened it was just smaller things. Like anytime I have to interact with B the guys will all just start laughing including B and its fucking humiliating. And S anytime I say anything to him, will again just start laughing at me as if I am the funniest person in the world. And they are definitely laughing AT me not with me. Like the vibe is definitely that I'm the weird kid they are all laughing at. Oh and this is weird but they never look me in the eyes, like its weirdly noticeable. Like when I'm asking them questions they will look away and laugh? But will never actually make eye contact with me. 

Okay so this next incident happened about a week ago. I was at work and we were super busy because we were a staff member short so I was having to do 2 jobs at once so I was super stressed and was behind on what I was doing. The phone rings and obviously I have to answer it so I do and its some guys wanting to pre-order drinks so I was like yeah sure. I asked him what he wanted and roughly how far away he was and the phone call was almost done and then he goes ""do u guys do delivery?"" And I was super confused cos he told me he wanted the coffees in mugs to have here and that he was only 1 minute away. So I was like ""yeah we do uber eats?"" And then he's like ""do you deliver to behind (name of my workplace)?"" And I was superrr confused like my brain wasn't working I was like wtf why does this man want me to deliver coffees in mugs to behind my own workplace?? So I was like ""sorry you wanted them delivered where...??"" And then he's like ""it's B from work"" and I heard them out the back pissing themselves laughing. I realised that I had been prank called so I was like ""wow so funny"" and hung up cos I was highkey pissed. I didn't make their coffees, another girl did but yeah that just again made me feel so embarrassed. 

And also this is really random but it's something I noticed when I first started working there. We had to make them coffees and whenever i would bring them out the back, I didn't know the guys names, so I would just yell out the name of the coffee and put it down. B always ordered a flat white and whenever I would call out that specific order S would start laughing as if that were hilarious????


So like from an outsiders perspective, what is happening here? Am I being bullied? Are they trying to have friendly banter with me??? And it's weird cos like they are nice to me sometimes, and they both say hi and bye to me but like when they are together they just laugh at me and it feels so humiliating. I don't know their ages but I'd guess B is 24 or 26 and S is 23?","Am I being bullied at work?

I also got pretty bad social anxiety around early middle school, which was unsurprisingly the last time that I made a new friend, and with my only friend going to a different college as me and the fact that we've completely lost touch, I do understand the loneliness.

I'm not sure about particular online resources, but I'm pretty sure that colleges have mental health counselors that can refer you to proper resources and get you the help that you want, so I recommend looking into that. I do believe that they're free, so if your parents are paying for your college, it won't show up on the bill, which may give you a greater sense of privacy.

As for social interactions, I'd say just kinda force yourself to at least attend some events where social interaction is possible if you feel comfortable enough to make that step. Clubs are probably the best option since you can actually be around people who have a similar interest as you, and it might help with the self-consciousness since you would have some degree of certainty that they'll be interested in listening to what you're saying. I recommend checking out smaller clubs since it might be somewhat less intimidating compared to larger ones and give you more opportunity for actually meaningful social interaction. Additionally, just focusing / finding some good hobbies can take your mind off of things.

Also, it's starting small. Find things that you aren't quite as anxious about. Try that for a bit and look at what you feared and what actually happens in those situations. It takes a while but after a bit you'll likely see improvement, and only then does it continue to harder stuff.

It was to the point that I was too anxious to leave the house for weeks and I had to go on a sick leave and subsequently because of my struggles, I left my job and started working for myself.

After a year, I started feeling a lot better, got to handle myself a little better, but lack of stable employment became a real problem - financially and mentally (I guess, I am not too good at looking for new gigs - 😬🤷). As a result, I decided to find a normal place to work. Big plus is, because of COVID, I am able to work from home which helps me with transition. However, as a junior employee, I am facing a lot of meetings where I need to prove my abilities (meetings to get on certain projects, job interview inside my job, didn't expect stuff like this would happen). Those meetings stress me out so much, that my mind goes blank and I forget half the stuff. It's been only two weeks and it makes me uneasy about my future at the company, and I honestly need a win when it comes to finding stable job 😅

I have moved and can't find therapist that I jibe with so I just need to know that things will be ok from someone that gets what I go through (unfortunately my family, with whom I am staying at the moment, can't see past my illness and just treat me as a diagnosis, not a human being).

To give some background, I just moved to another state and I’m the only new senior at the school I’m at right now. Everyone has been very nice and to me and I've made friends but I haven’t found someone who I am completely comfortable around, but that’s pretty normal for me when making new friends especially after quarantine. Even before I moved, I have never been to a high school party. The only “party” I went to was one that my college friend threw for me after my junior prom and it was more of a hangout with our friends (and I was pretty uncomfortable the whole time because my brother was there).

I'm pretty much am always super anxious when it comes to social events. Like usually I'm fine if I'm hanging out in a group of people who are all my friends. And if I'm going to a concert or something surrounded by people who I don't know at all and likely won't see again I'm totally fine. But when it comes to hanging out with people I know but not that well (like the majority of my grade), I literally get so anxious.

Anyway today I was invited to go to a party and I was going to go. I was pretty excited at first because 1) this would be my first real party, 2) I want to get closer with the people that are going, and 3) I don't want to be seen as the person who never goes out. Well later on as I was figuring out the rides and what I was going to wear, I started getting super anxious, like the same anxiety I normally get during social events. Anyway, I basically broke down crying while I was trying to decide what to do and eventually decided to just stay home with my family (like I do every night). While I was crying to my mom, she said that I didn't have to go to this party but she was worried because she thinks I should go to a party before college and she thinks that if I keep declining invitations like this, people will stop inviting me.

 I can't pinpoint what exactly makes me feel anxious about going to a  party. I have been invited to go to other parties before and I initially get excited, but I pretty much always end up not going due to social anxiety. I know that some of the times I do go to some sort of event I do have fun, but that's usually because I would cling to a close friend's side for the entirety of it. Also, I feel like the whole ""be safe and smart"" thing my parent say freaks me out-I don't know why. Anyway, I hung out with my family for the night and I enjoyed it like I always do. I mean I was a little sad thinking about how I was missing out but I was mostly glad I didn't go. I know that when I stay in my little bubble with my family, I feel safe and comfortable. But that's not going to be a good thing because I know I'm going to have to live life on my own soon. Anyway I know I'm totally rambling and I'm not even sure what I'm even trying to do with this post. Also, I have a therapist and she's really good so no need to worry about that. 

tldr: I've never been to a party and I was invited to one tonight but I panicked and ended up not going like I always have. I always stay in with my family and have terrible anxiety whenever I'm planning on going out.","I am too anxious to go to a high school party","Help","hp13eu4","MrFlubberNut","/r/socialanxiety/comments/rj34ch/i_am_too_anxious_to_go_to_a_high_school_party/hp13eu4/",1,1639818276,"
This whole thing looks and feels so familiar because all of this happens to as well, each and everytime I'm invited somewhere.

&gt;I just moved to another state
I haven't moved, but I did start new school, and even I find it really difficult to be comfortable with someone.
I mean I do talk to everyone, (this is pretty surprising for me in itself), but I can't seem to actually connect with someone.


&gt; I have never been to a high school party
In the beginning of this year, I was supposed to go to a freshers party, (not for my school, but for my cousins), i thought it would be like a practice run for if i had to go to another one with *my classmates*. I thought if something went wrong, i really don't have to meet anyone there except my cousin, and he already knows I'm weird, so no har no foul. I was pretty excited when he invited me, it was supposed to be in a club, and just like you, I've never been to a party or a club. But one day before I was supposed to go i started overthinking about the evening and started second guessing everything. Just like you said, i was figuring out how to go, and what I'll wear, i started getting anxious like you.

It's not that I don't even like hanging out with friends, i just don't like meeting new people, and huge crowds.
I don't know how to make friends, and it's really surprising that I around 6-7 of them from the previous school, and how we went to one of my friends vacation house, and took another trip with them.

Everyday, while in bed, i think about how more and more difficult it is gonna get for me to go out in the crowd as I keep on avoiding it. I know this i shouldn't be scared everytime I get invited somewhere, or Even get a simple call from an unknown number, o Start panicking, but I just can't help it. I just can't find the confidence to talk to someone new.","t3_rj34ch","t3_rj34ch","socialanxiety","reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/rj34ch/i_am_too_anxious_to_go_to_a_high_school_party/"

Having social anxiety, I’m ridiculously quiet at work and keep to myself- but I work in the restaurant industry which is always a very social atmosphere. So I’ve been getting a lot of coworkers joking about how I’m so quiet. Lately there’s been lots of jokes about me being a murderer. “Watch out for the quiet one,” “Don’t get on her hit list,” etc. 
I try to brush it off but damn I hate being this way. My brain is just frozen at work and besides the regular ‘script’ that I use with customers, I can’t converse worth a damn.

I'd like to change that, as I'm going to be a new mother, (due jan 28th with my baby boy) and I need some support from other parents here who have social anxiety. So allow me to introduce myself:

I'm 37, and have suffered from social anxiety, ocd and general anxiety since I was a kid. I also have Fibromyalgia with daily aches and pains.

I'm terrified of being a mom, but I'm extremely excited as well. I have a loving and supportive husband who understands me for the most part. We can't wait to bring our baby boy into the world! We have been together for 11 years, and married for 4. We met online. For years we struggled with infertility and had 2 miscarriages in the past year.

I'm a stay at home wife, on disability since I was 26. I do go out of the house a few times a week, but I also don't drive, as that is one of my triggers. I mostly am just a homebody, barely see anyone other than my parents once a week and strangers. I have a couple friends but hardly see them.

I have seen various counselors over the years but not currently seeing once since before covid. They honestly have never been of much help.

I am no longer medicated, I stopped my Prozac a few weeks ago for baby’s sake after he is born, and will try to breastfeed.

One of my worries for bringing a baby into the world is being around others, in public and even simple visitors like friends and family, doctors, strangers at grocery store, restaurants, etc. I worry about being stared at while holding or interacting with my baby. I worry about the attention he will draw to me or to us. How do you guys cope with that? I'm seriously hoping there are other parents in here. When I have too much attention on me, I blush or fear I'll blush, I can't focus, I feel like I basically go dumb and act airheaded or fear ill say something stupid. I sweat, and sometimes shake.

I also worry about being able to think clearly with baby when I'm around others. How can I learn to focus clearly on what others are saying when I have a baby to watch? 

 In laws live 8 hours away and it has always been tough when visiting them or them visiting us. Adding a baby to the mix is going to make it so much harder. I tend to be nervous, uncomfortable or just awkward around my SIL, BIL and FIL. (Hell even my own parents sometimes) I desensitize/depersonalize or go through bouts of derealization around them. I generally just don't feel myself, and have to put on an act to appear outgoing when internally, I'm suffering.

"rm4106","4pop13","/r/socialanxiety/comments/rm4106/afraid_new_friend_will_hate_me_if_she_doesnt/",1,1640175287,"I just hung out with a new friend with my older sister. They both are perfect for one another (they like and believe the same things). We met her because of her business and this was the first time we've hung out socially.

We talked the whole time, and in the moment I felt fine, but after it all I started getting worried about the future of our friendship.

She has a very strong personality and based on what we were talking about alone, I could see her talking bad about me behind my back if I made one mistake. Because of this, she's not someone I would normally mingle with in the first place; she's more my sister's type. I'm really only friends her because I'm close with my sister and we get along. But I do worry about disagreeing with her because she seems so set in her ways and I feel like I would have to be the one making a compromise (because I always am).

Maybe I'm having flashbacks to being pressured to be a ""yes"" man to my old ""friends"" in middle school and I don't want to be in that kind of one-sided relationship again. Maybe it really is just all in my head and my thoughts are being irrational. Maybe I've just been caught up in this friendship I never would have initiated on my own and having a hard time dealing with it. Maybe I'm just being selfish and trying to take the easy way out. I can't tell.

I was reminded of why I avoid making friends in the first place, which is because I assume everyone will hate me if they got to know me. So I'm afraid of becoming one more person in her list of people she hates, especially because when she hates someone, she *hates* them.","Afraid New Friend will Hate Me if she Doesn't Already","Help","hpjy8pn","Overall_Sandwich_671","/r/socialanxiety/comments/rm4106/afraid_new_friend_will_hate_me_if_she_doesnt/hpjy8pn/",1,1640179812,"You don't have to be friends with her just because she's your sister's friend. I used to hang out with my siblings and their friends, but after a while, I realised it wasn't doing my confidence any good, because they probably wouldn't have looked twice at me if I wasn't their friend's little brother. I was civil with them, sure, but I didn't form attachments to them. I eventually learned I am capable of making my own friends.

This woman sounds like a very black and white person. She probably reacts strongly to things that don't particularly bother you (this is just the impression I'm getting) and this is probably where you and she are going to clash. You probably feel that she has the stronger personality because she speaks up more frequently, But she probably does have her own insecurities, and covers them up by being outspoken.

I'm not really sure what sort of advice to give you, but if she does give you any shit, take a breath, don't immediately blame yourself for her outburst, and take on a laid back ""I don't really give a fuck what you think"" attitude towards her.","t3_rm4106","t3_rm4106","socialanxiety","reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/rm4106/afraid_new_friend_will_hate_me_if_she_doesnt/"

27F, been on and off the apps for years. I’ve tried them all, I’m now trying bumble because the guys that have been reaching out to me I wasn’t interested in (luck still sucks). The one time I dated a guy for a few months, I wanted it to end because I feel like I settled due to lack of physical attraction. Now, I’ve been on bumble for a brief while and met up with two guys. The first guy seemed to like me but I didn’t like him. I just met up with another guy, we talked for a few hours and he seemed interested in meeting up again. I enjoyed talking to him I’m just not sure if I would want to take it any further, part of me is kind of interested in going out a second time but I remember how I settled for the last guy I saw for a few months. I ended up seeing the second guy Saturday and was kind of irritated by him, he ended up saying that he wasn’t feeling it from me &amp; thinks it won’t work out. I wouldn’t have gone out again but it’s the fact that he ended things first. I want the romance from dating, just a little note that I don’t really have sexual desire. I like the thought of intimacy like kissing etc but I don’t masturbate and haven’t had sex in years. Could that contribute to my lack of success? Or am I just not meeting the right guys? I feel like dating shouldn’t be this hard, my life is all about shutting down the ones I don’t want &amp; the ones I do want don’t feel the same way. Social anxiety is also behind why it’s that much harder but only so much. 

TL; DR: Bad luck in love or am I the culprit?

I’ve had many thoughts like “What would happen if I killed myself” I think how peoples reactions would be. I think about if they would even care and who would care more, if they would really miss me. I’ve gone through scenarios in my head like I can’t do it anymore and I search for help and I like feeling like people care. Sounds super selfish, I know. But basically I imagine my therapist and parents wanting to help and be worried about me (meaning they care) and I like that feeling, feeling that others care. My parents do care about me like they feed me and give em all I need. They don’t quite understand mental health though… not really their fault though. 

Im NOT going to kill myself. I’m excited and looking forward to date, get married, get a career, and start my own family. No matter how hard it gets I won’t do it because I know it can hurt others and lead them to do dumb things too.


If I were to tell my therapist about these thoughts and feelings would she tell my parents even though I tell her I won’t do it? Is there a chance she’ll still think y life is in danger and tell them? Because in reality I don’t want anyone to know my parents would be mad and think I’m crazy probably. They’ll say stuff like “god have you this life and you need to be thankful” which will only make em feel worse because I know it’s true.


Im just so stuck and feel so sad I want more people in my life to care about me.

It takes courage.

It is absolutely normal to feel nervous/unable to communicate properly when you like someone. At this point you are high with emotion, and thinking clearly will require more mental focus/strength to get you point across. Everyone whom I know has went through this.

That being said, here are some things I learned to consider when dealing with a crush.

 Making the effort to communicate. When I'm around louder, seemingly more confident people, I do the following: ask about them (what they like, what they believe in) and listen. Letting people talk about themselves (AND REMEMBERING WHAT THEY SAY TO YOU) makes you memorable in their eyes. Plus you get to learn new and sometimes cool things. Another tip would be if you've seen something they like to do on social media, ask ""Hey, what's your opinion on (insert subject matter)?""

Assessing your way of thinking. How you see yourself and the world will define the quality of your life. Why do you think this person is out of league? Do you actually think you are not good enough? Say if this person were to not acknowedlge you, how you you really feel? I suggest refraining from putting anyone on a pedestal. If you do, you are giving another human being just like you all the power in the world. We are all people at the end of the day, capable of laughing, crying, and dealing with strengths and insecurities.

Master the art of thinking logically when emotionally high. If I asked you to speak to someone who you aren't attracted to, you can say anything that comes to mind. It's a whole new ballgame when you like the person a lot. You will have to try harder and push yourself more on a mental level. This also applies when you are sad, angry, etc. The ability to think and act clearly when filled with emotion is an invaluable skill when it comes to life. Regardless of the outcome, look to focus on the experience to see how you deal with the emotion, and make the effort to speak with this person like you would anyone else. Making the effort now will give you more confidence for future moments with this person or anybody you have feelings for.

Being aware of the reality that this may be an infatuation that can go as quickly as it came. Many crushes and dates don't lead to long term relationships. People fall in and out of love so quickly it's nuts. One minute you or they may be very interested in the other , then after one conversation or meetup, you or they may lose interest in each other. This happens a lot more than one thinks. So accepting this fact is important as unless you are extremely lucky, there is a high likelyhood you will come across this reality. Don't get discoruaged if this happens to you or the other person. I suggest trying to look at this situation as a way to learn more about yourself, what you really want in partner, and to find at least at least two positive notes about you speaking to/dating someone you like (the fact that you are showing the coruage and initiative to try to speak to this person is an immediate point).

I know I said a lot but I hope some of this helps you out. Don't sell yourself short. We all have something to offer. Good luck, from a guy who has been diagnosed with anxiety and depression, and who is now happily married 8 years to a lovely person.","t3_rsld37","t3_rsld37","socialanxiety","reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/rsld37/dating_lifetalking_to_new_people/"

Tonight's party got really lame after certain people got pointlessly pissed at our group and there were no ""chill"" or decent moments to just sit down and have a nice talk before. We walked to the party together because of a small accident, and that was like, the best part of the whole night, since we really got going. We later created each other's Mii avatar as well, which was kinda cute. Unfortunately, she had to go home earlier than pretty much everyone else because of... overprotective parenting, lmao.

For context: she's a very introvert and inexperienced ""girly girl"", not having had any sort of relationship beforehand. After all, her besties warned me the journey would've been long and exhausting. With that said, she's very charismatic, mentally sharp and self-aware, and I really doubt she hasn't noticed my blatant flirting yet or that she's just playing with my feelings for her.

Am I just overthinking this or what, lol?

So, recently I got a new job working at one of the nearby university athletic departments. I read the job description and it was all stuff I had done before. Normal cleaning duties, basic upkeep, etc. In this case clearly being bathrooms, rooms, offices, locker rooms, etc. I didn’t think much of it. I started last week and a lot of what I do is cleaning womens sports locker rooms. I’m a 20(M) for context. I didn’t think much again until my coworker told me that they have had people not care and just undress in front of them, make and female. Also, they said sometimes when I always announce “maintenance” people will simple not answer.

 This made me get lots of really bad anxiety because now I just imagine a girl walking in on me and undressing and then it being my fault, or I walk in on a girl that failed to tell me she was there. There are no cameras or anything obviously, so I just have so much worry I’m going to get blamed for something that I tried to prevent and lose my job and worse stuff happening. 

What should I do? I don’t want to leave the job. I already have some anxiety issues, I don’t know if I’m just being a crazy worry wart or what I should do.","M(20) I have lots of anxiety about new job, advice wanted. Situation detailed below.

I tried that approach! It’s been two years now. Close to three—since I faced a major failure (in my eyes, of course) and self isolated. Thought it would be better if the people I love didn’t see my current or impending struggle(s).

Thought I would come back and *wow em*! ;) And I certainly did by dropping off the map and remaining almost completely unreachable since. 

Now nobody tries to stay in touch. Why would they make the effort? They haven’t heard from me in YEARS! Except when I send a bi-yearly sporadic apology for my absence and go ghost again. 

Had a friend reach last week because he was in town for the holidays. He texted me kindly asking if I’d show up for drinks and bowling with a few of my closest high school friends. 

I agreed, picked my face into oblivion, and cancelled last minute. Now I have a voicemail in my inbox I’m too scared to open, and my friend(s) went back to their college town(s). I miss them like hell; yet I haven’t done a thing to show it. I’m sure it hurts them too but maybe not anymore. 

They’ll be graduating in the spring and starting good ol life! Meanwhile I’ve put mine on hold.

I haven’t went out to get groceries since August. I drive my car probably weekly if I can manage. I take loads of meds. Trying to quit weed. Getting help (therapy), but needing someone who understands. Crying in the shower now after typing this haha. 

I don’t want to be melodramatic. So I apologize for that, but I’ve lost myself in this isolation that was supposed to be a “better me”. 

Ive always struggled with social anxiety but I grew up with friends who would force me out the door. Now I’m in college and I hate it. I hate me for not loving my twenties. I hate the scabs I’ve created, weight I’ve gained, and people I’ve lost. 

I miss awkward hugs and “grabbing coffee”. I miss people telling me they want me around even if I’m hesitant to fully engage. I miss the me who was even 1% less anxious to be around; to be even moderately present for life. 

Off the grid is the fucking *perfect* escape if the destination you so desire is the relentless chatter growing within the confines of your own head!

It might sound pathetic, but it can be draining to spend so much time on all of the things which you, probably, think hinder you in life and I'm saying that as someone who can deal with a lot of things in a very busy job. I'd say it's common to feel defeated after having sessions because it feels like talking can't do anything and any goals they give you, you don't think you can manage them, so you feel like you're never going to get anywhere and you might even start to feel pre-session stress or anxiety if you then start to dread that sense of defeat you know will come from your next session, as it seems counter productive to achieving any sort of positive outcome.

Like someone will have said, it is possible that some people just don't work for you, and you may need to say that and try and find someone else. It can be difficult if it's the only person you've seen, because you have no one to compare to, so don't know if you and that person just don't work, or if it's sessions in general that don't work for you. Also the fact that it can be so hard and take so long to see someone, you might not want to throw that away, but spending many sessions with someone that doesn't work can be counter productive and leave you with a negative outlook towards sessions in future.

In terms of them setting goals or objectives, you could always discuss your thoughts with them. If you feel like the objective is unachievable, tell them. If you feel like you will come to the next session without having achieved your goal, tell them. It may be a negative mindset leaving you unable to see the possibility of you ever achieving anything, which could be a confidence issue. It may be that the objective is too vague; if the aim they gave you is literally ""be assertive"", tell them you need something more specific to take smaller steps, rather than trying to adjust such a wide concept. Maybe it could be ""say yes when it's appropriate when otherwise you may have said no"" or, likewise, ""say no to someone you might have otherwise said yes to just to be polite/didn't want to turn down"" or ""interrupt someone, as politely as possible, but firmly, if you have a counter thought to something they are saying rather than wait for them to finish and then ask for your input"" or ""put yourself forward for something you know you have the ability to do, even if you don't think you have the confidence to do it"". All of those things would amount to you being more assertive, without prescribing the ""aim"" of ""being more assertive"" and then you don't have to worry about this vague concept of ""being assertive"" without any tangible things to actually put into practice.","t3_pxapts","t3_pxapts","socialanxiety","reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/pxapts/is_it_normal_to_feel_worse_after_a_couple_of/"

I am comfortable talking with 1 to 1 face to face talk if my mood is good. But i can't speak in group of 3 and more people face to face. 

When i join any office colleagues or classmates group i  start judging quickly and my mind fills with thoughts like "" i looks ugly "" "" i don't look handsome"" ""what if i say something wrong and all will start laughing about me"" etc. 

I want to make females friends also but i scare to talk with girls of my age. My trainer/teachers says in front of everyone "" me(name) is so shy silent person in the class"" i really feel bad at the time. 

I want to feel the happiness of being giving respect to me by friends, wants to go on movie with friends etc like social life works.

Pls help me to achieve this in 2022 that by end of this year i can create friends who are truly love , respect, give importance to me.call me on movie or traveling etc.

I just turned 20 and am in my first year of community college (I took a gap year) and there’s few opportunities for interaction at my school. 
I’ve had a boyfriend for the past 9 months, and every time I would be in a group situation with his friends or family I would be extremely socially anxious and unable to know what to say, when to speak, and often times what the point of the interaction was at all. 

I understand how it could be fun for people who know how to interact and for people who are already good friends with each other to do things in groups and go to parties together, but due to being rejected so much socially I have developed this “What? I don’t even get the point of those types of ‘shallow’ interactions” type of mindset. Like “oh so I’m not cool enough to do that, so that thing isn’t even cool to me anymore anyway so whatever” lol type of mindset. 

I genuinely do not know how to navigate group interactions or even one on one platonic interactions and despite actively working on it still harbor so much envy toward those who do. 

My boyfriend and my therapist have both described me as being very personable when they each first met me as I was raised to be very polite. I also went on this group backpacking trip program last summer and I remember certain people being very shocked after being around me for a week or so to hear that I hadn’t spoken with pretty much anyone other than my parents for like 6+ years. But I still developed zero bond with any of these people in my age range with whom I had a lot in common and was in the middle of the wilderness doing challenging things with every day for a month. Sleeping near them, eating with them, doing memorable things like climbing mountains with them, but I made no real connections bc I was too afraid to talk in group interactions. 

I know I am very naïve and rely on self deprecating humor and just giggle too much in general out of nervousness, and so people begin to treat me like I’m stupid or immature and I don’t like that feeling. I think that’s a bit narcissistic bc I just want to be seen in a positive light… I want to be normal if not “cool” haha. 

About a month and a half into dating each other my bf was like “oh by the way I tell everyone you’re my gf” and that was exactly what I wanted to hear, but despite that I still hated saying that I had a bf and would say the word “boyfriend” with gritted teeth for like a month after that. Bc I had had so much resentment toward girls who were pretty and liked by boys and all around “good enough” to have boyfriends bc I felt I wasn’t for so long and then developed an “ew romantic relationships are gross nobody likes me and I’ve developed this weird pride and attachment to that identity” thing as I still have about platonic relationships.

Due to always fucking up in social situations and often times apparently doing a horrible job despite thinking I was following all the rules and doing okay, I have become very confused about the whole thing and extremely self conscious. I don’t know who I should be and what I’m allowed to do basically, and am probably narcissistically hyper-vigilant and concerned with what others think of me. 

Every day, and sometimes subconsciously, I’m observing others and trying to learn how to act and who to be to avoid rejection. I am constantly trying to figure people out so to speak and feel ridiculously, illogically different from others.

I have to try so hard not to give too much away, because I just want them to know as little about me as possible. But I feel like I can't win, because if I don't give them every little detail they want, they'll try to get information from friends. 

I know that my SA makes me assume the worst of people. I also know I care way too much about what other people think. However, I just know everything I say is being used as gossip for the next person they see. The most annoying thing is, everybody loves this person. They somehow manage to get everything they want, and everything goes their way. I know I shouldn't feel this way, but I'm very frustrated. 

It's so hard to deal with people like this and I don't know what to do anymore. I find myself already dreading the next time they want to hang out, and it hasn't even happened yet. 

TLDR; My ""friend"" makes me extremely anxious because they judge me, talk sh*t about others, and seem to want the worst for me.

One month ago.
1. I being told to be transfer to a new department which is 2hrs away from my home. Used to be 30min to work.
2. They only give me three weeks notice about my transfer. I’m not ready for a new environment, new job scope, new colleagues, new working time, new distance and new culture.
3. I will be reduced back to ground level after working so hard to reach my position here. From supervisor to ground level. 
4. I know I cannot maintain healthy weight as this job doesn’t give me enough break for a healthy meal. I struggle to get my weight up  to a average level for 10 years. Now i have even less time to eat or rest due to long commute. ( I always get body shame for being too skinny and it affect me alot)
5. My mental health is bad due to problems and frustration at work.
6. But is a good stable income for me. My salary will be the same at the new location.
7. But i quit the job before i being transferred to that new place. As i got enough saving to last for few years. I got no motivation to go through that new location.
8. I also propose to a girl that i like for two years and get rejected. She say that she already with someone else. I feel that coming as she start distance from me for awhile.

Now after a month 

1. My physical health is good. I gain 5 kg and workout well. My body look nicer now.
2. My mental health is still very very bad . 
3. I lost my identity as my life is just work and home. Now it’s just home and overthink .
4. I able to survive for many years due to the money i saved. But the insecurity feeling of no income is there.
5. I overthink everyday about my job and my crush.
6. I afraid that i had make the wrong decision of resignation. i will not be able to find a new job anymore due to my anxiety. I scare to try or learn new things. I get anxiety when I’m at a new environment or new people. I will wobble physically when I’m in that situation. So i tend to avoid new people or place. I not confidence in my skill to get any job at all. ( my anxiety seems to get worse during this two years of covid, used to be manageable)
7. I over think about the chances i missed with this girl. If only i brave enough to try when she still available i will not have missed out on her. ( even tho i know that she never been sincere to me and we not really click with each other). We stop contact with each other after my propose. 

Everyday i will pray( I’m free thinker, i pray to the universe) , breathing exercise and workout physically.

I got good progress for my physical. In just a month. I gain 5 kg and muscles.

But, 
I cannot get over this past job and this girl out of my mind. I can’t find the path to do anything for my mind. I try read book or upgrade my language skill but I can’t focus at all. 

Right now i got no job, no relationship, no friend and no family. No motivation. Scare of this world. I feel so helpless and lost.

I live in a country w affordable healthcare and so at certain ages you get free treatment. Because of that, they usually book the standard appointments. I think it’s every year or every other year. You can ofc book if you have current issues.

I have trouble with jaw. Certain movements are restricted. I have chronic pain in the area etc. my dentist has offered a treatment but I want to look at other options. I’m scared to tell him.

Every time I’ve gone, I’ve pumped myself us and promised that I would be brave and speak. Every time he asks for my issues I go mute. I just shrug my shoulders or laugh. Inside I’m just screaming, trying to make myself talk but it never works.
I used to have someone go with me to the dentist but I got a comment from my previous dentist that I (20) was old enough to go to appointments alone. I felt so humiliated.

I’m so scared that my current dentist will think that I’m exaggerating symptoms or that I’m trying to be a fraud and get something that I don’t deserve. That I’m just wasting the country’s money when others need it more.

I have always been one. Even though I know it, so it should be easy to fix, you would think, but it is not easy. Often people take advantage of such personalities. Or Sometimes I may take a loss to myself to help someone gain. Feeling approval from others is always very prevalent. As in even if someone is putting me down, I would just stay quiet or even smile as if I didn't hear or understand. Which only makes you look weak and foolish to others.

People with this type of personality are not respected by the world.  They are the people that others might take advantage of, or feel sorry for. Being overly nice does not make people melt for you. What should a person do? it seems so easy, but easier said then actually done. When you have Social Anxiety.

Recently I realized that even though I have been a pushover all my life. Now people seem to treat my kids and wife with the same attitude that they treat me. Probably because they think I wont stand up to them anyway, so they don't think twice. This is very disturbing to me. Realizing that others would treat my family with low respect because that's the expectations ""I"" have set to them.

I'm looking to break out of the Pushover personality. I'm 33 and have been one al my life, so don't know how that's gonna happen. I would never be a jerk or bully. But if only I could stand up for myself.

It did help me not get anxious about sitting there with her but I was still too anxious to talk and say anything. 
She would ask me questions but my answers were always super short or a nod or head shaking. When I tried to talk my voice would break and it would be hard… she asked me if I had anything I wanted to talk about today and I shook my head. (Even though that had been the worst week of my life I couldn’t get myself to talk) 

so she just told me a story and we just talked about random stuff because I wouldn’t freaking speak. She said that therapy is the perfect place to practice and basically told me I need to talk (in a softer way) but I couldn’t! I have my next one tomorrow and im scared the same will happen.

Disclaimer: don’t expect magic results the first time you do this. It takes practice.

There’s loads on google if you search ‘personal mantra for anxiety’ or ‘anxiety affirmations’

Also, some people prefer ‘I am’ type mantras, others prefer ‘you are’. How we speak to ourselves in our heads has a big impact so it’s something to pay attention to.

15M, this is a burner account. In elementary/middle school, I was an outgoing kid and I made a lot of friends in  my school. I felt really comfortable around my peers and actually enjoyed school. Over COVID, my family made the decision to move across the country. When I started my 8th grade year, I was so socially awkward, nothing like I was before. I would hardly say anything in an entire school day, and whenever someone would talk to me my face would get really red and I wouldn’t know what to say. This behavior continued throughout the whole year, I didn’t manage to make a single friend. I never knew what to say when someone tried to talk to me. Going into my high school year, I thought it was going to be different. After all, nobody knew each other so everybody would be trying to make friends. I was wrong. Although I talked a bit more in class, I am still insanely awkward. I think my issue is that it’s really difficult for me to express my thoughts. I can think of something perfectly good in my head, but when I try to convey that thought I sound like a moron. I also get really confused on simple social queues. For example, when somebody waves at me, I try to smile and wave back but I end up looking really stupid and I get really flustered. I also have no clue how to go up to somebody and start a conversation. Eye contact is also really confusing for me, like when I look around the classroom and I try to avoid looking at people but then the deliberate avoidance makes me look like more of a creep. I really want to make friends, because it’s already halfway through my freshman year and I haven’t gone out a single night.

My social anxiety made what should have been a wonderful experience, quite a miserable one. I have really high dreams of getting into a Ph.D. program so I have had to really immerse myself into research labs, organizations, lab meetings, and communicating with professors. I don't think I can do this much longer and it's tearing me apart because I want nothing more than to achieve my dream, I am so passionate about my studies, but my anxiety is making it so hard. Every conversation I had with a professor or a peer, I analyze in my head over and over afterward and it drives me up the wall. I embarrass myself so easily, my anxiety is very obvious and it makes me a very nervous talker so I mess up a lot in conversation and often make a fool of myself. I can't stop obsessing over the stupid things I have said and done. Before every lab meeting or lecture, I will obsess for weeks about how I will walk in, where I sit when I should come in so that I bring the least amount of attention to me possible. When I have meetings with professors, I am usually silent the whole time on the verge of a panic attack and when they ask me questions I always say something stupid or say I don't know, even though I truly know the answers, but at the moment my brain just freezes and all sense of coherency and rationality leaves me.

I will definitely go nowhere in life like this, it just is not possible. My brain turns the smallest social responsibilities into the biggest deal and I become so obsessive and plan out every minute movement that I should do in a social situation. It's like I am creating a screenplay in my head with stage directions and everything just to get through a small meeting, a lecture, but once I'm there I shut down and everything goes awry anyway. I feel so abnormal, I look at people around me and they just don't care. They are unapologetically themselves, they make bold jokes, make small conversations look effortless, and they eventually reach their dreams. I want to be them so bad, I want to know how it feels like to not be constantly in your head overanalyzing all your most embarrassing, cringeworthy moments.

&amp;#x200B;

I mostly just needed to vent because I truly have no one to talk to. But ideally, I would love to hear what things help everyone else. How did you get through college?

He was not understanding at all and told me I was being difficult. He didn’t understand why I struggled putting on my cam. His reaction left me completely heart broken.

That’s already a big step worth celebrating. I think you did great being honest with him about your anxiety and how you’re trying to step out of your comfort zone, and to be honest I’m more concerned about his lack of sympathy and understanding. You didn’t do anything wrong, and telling you you were being difficult was completely out of line; it’s not like you were purposely choosing to avoid him. If you didn’t explain about your anxiety I can see how he might have been a bit taken aback by your reaction, but you did explain and he still didn’t react kindly which raises a bit of a red flag for me.  
That said, if you’d still like to give him another shot (and please keep in mind you deserve nothing less than someone who is understanding of your social anxiety and supportive of you!) you could try starting out the call with your camera off, then maybe after you’ve eased into the conversation a bit turn it on. Or you could just plan to have the camera on for a short, predetermined amount of time. If the idea of doing the entire video call with the camera on is overwhelming, try something like 1 minute at a time, or whatever increment would be slightly challenging, but still doable, and do your best to stick to it. Then, increase that amount little by little over time.   
Whatever you decide, let him know in advance so he knows what to expect and remember that you’ve done nothing wrong. If he still doesn’t react with understanding, it’s not your job to try to convince him, and it may not feel like it now, but I promise there are other people out there who would be kinder and more patient.

"s0l7uz","truthfulshoes","/r/socialanxiety/comments/s0l7uz/is_anyone_else_socially_anxious_partially_because/",1,1641824707,"I get rubbed the wrong way by so many things. I feel like I hold other people to the highest of expectations and feel upset or wronged when people don't follow these expectations. 

For example, I get fed up with teasing and often will not engage with it even if everyone else doesn't mind being teased. I can seem like a stick in the mud for not finding it funny. 

If Person A does not see that Person B is clearly uncomfortable by how Person A is talking to them, I can get annoyed that they didn't notice. I don't expect the uncomfortable person to say they are uncomfortable because I know how hard that is to do.

Basically if someone is not very considerate, I find it incredibly hard to socialize with these people even if I generally like who they are as a person. 

This is because I don't like telling people things that I don't like that they do, and I dont know how to accept these things either. I struggle to let some of it go and can ruminate on some of the stuff they've done. I also try to hold myself to these impossibly high standards and think if I can do it, others should too.

I think this comes from just experiencing rejection and pain from people in childhood enough that I take a lot of things personally. I have become overly considerate and become frustrated when others don't meet me halfway. I give up pretty quickly when something feels like the other person isn't going to try. 

This plays into my anxiety because I get anxious that people will see me be negative. Or that I will find myself feeling negative in a social atmosphere and won't be able to escape. Or that the only thoughts I can think about are negative, and as a result I won't be able to focus on my environment and I'll make things awkward for others. Or even worse, I fear for someone else to catch me being inconsiderate (because of how negative I am, I often actually am exactly what I don't want to be.. inconsiderate)

I struggle not to hold dumb grudges on people for doing the stupidest of things. I once held a grudge for ages because someone had an angry outburst at me for something that wasn't worth the outburst, and I was upset because I didn't think it was necessary to raise their voice. After months of ruminating on this and distancing myself from this person, my boyfriend finally managed to make me stop by convincing me that she genuinely tries not to be angry but she has always struggled with controlling anger.

Does anyone know how to stop being so judgmental like this? I know it is not good. Sometimes when I try to tell myself the judgment is not good, I only end up judging myself for having it and I just shut down and feel like I am beyond a point of being able to speak to others.","Is anyone else socially anxious partially because you are overly judgmental of others?","Help","hs2enwp","Sotnos99","/r/socialanxiety/comments/s0l7uz/is_anyone_else_socially_anxious_partially_because/hs2enwp/",1,1641825301,"I experience feelings like this all the time as well, I'm diagnosed with anxiety and autism and in my case, this sort of ""unreasonable anger"" is usually tied a lot more to my autistic traits from like, not understanding social situations properly.

Throughput my time working with him we barely spoken a few words but he will talk if you initiate the conversation and is mostly friendly.  I have social anxiety so no more than a hi is said (on rare occasions). It would help to mention that I am attracted to him and it’s frustrating. The main way we seem to communicate is through eye contact. Sometimes he will look at me and smile but other days if I walk past him, he will avoid eye contact and look at the ground. I will admit I do the same sometimes. The eye contact is so intense sometimes and I freak out. I barely see this co-worker (sometimes a week or more) so I haven’t gotten used to him.

Please skim read the next paragraph, I doubt you'll care about it.

I think I had a normal early childhood. This normal life started to deviate when I was around 10, few years after moving out from my grandparents' household. Since then, social interactions severely decreased outside school peers (almost all my friends were my classmates); I think this is where self-diagnosed SAD developed. Six years later, I rarely talked and met with them because I transferred to a different school. I met new friends there, but pandemic screwed everything up, and I were unable to ""fix"" my social life. Now I'm almost 19.

Since I transferred school, I noticed some self destructive behaviours ""seemingly outside"" usual SAD symptoms that I will elaborate:
(1) Trust issues - not the usual ""I can't believe them, they are lying and betray me,"" but rather ""I can't tell them, they will tell others and ridicule me."" I never tell anyone how i feel nor open up ,thus relationships do not progress,
(2) Suppressed thoughts - I never confront people, probably caused by inferiority complex,
(3) Obsession with the concept of equality - I get envious when my peers succeed, I feel disgusted when I succeed my peers. This is purely for peers; I do not care if strangers do better than me and vice versa, as long as I and my relations are not affected,
(4) Possessiveness [?] - I find myself clingy and also crave their recognition. When I start socialising with them, I never want it to end. I don't talk to them if we are not associated in a while.

Written from memory; I do not take note of these so I surely might have missed some, but I feel they're enough.

I think I will be evading socialisation as a result. If you think there are other options, please suggest to me. I do not want to be alone but it certainly feels better than fighting against the anxiety and above issues. I also will not be seeing theraphy or take medication.","insane Crazy situation with social relationships","Help","hrwhtgk","khadaisuki","/r/socialanxiety/comments/rzpm1v/insane_crazy_situation_with_social_relationships/hrwhtgk/",1,1641727389,"I am sure I typed the issues in a bullet type.

At times it feels impossible.

How can I follow my dreams when I struggle to go outside? I hate being around people, I feel like I have to be perfect and put on a performance to even feel remotely accepted. 

School was horrible. People told me I was miserable, always asking why are you so quiet? does he talk? what’s his name? … I’m 23 now and these moments during my time in high school still play on my mind. 

I think school did have a a strong influence on why I’ve become what I’ve become, it made me become a recluse for years and years. I’ve struggled holding down part time jobs, I just can’t feel comfortable being around people at all. Like, i want to! But I simply can’t.

I can’t be me.

My mind goes blank in conversation, I feel I’m boring, I’ve been told I’m boring multiple times in my life. I want to just live life to the fullest and do the things I want to do.

Friendships and relationships have faded ever since I left high school. I only really talk to my family and even then they judge me for being awkward, not going out as much as them.

I feel all of this pushes me to want to be on my own, but I know that isn’t healthy. I want to feel comfortable being myself around people.

My point is that it's something that you naturally learn, alone sometimes, or through the proper entourage (which you have to find yourself). Even though you turn 18, people aren't gonna tell you ""Nope you're an adult now, you deal with it alone"".  Sure, legally you turned into an adult, but it's pretty clear when someone is confused/lost because of a lack of experience, and unless you're surrounded by assholes, people will help you.

"ntz6zp","sleepingonmehead","/r/socialanxiety/comments/ntz6zp/is_there_a_paid_buddy_system_to_equip_people_with/",1,1623024040,"Hi there everyone, in need of advice. I'm going to cross-post this in quite a few places, so apologies if you've already seen it around. A lot of background info incoming, my main question is the bit bolded underneath. 

I'm 17 and I applied to a bunch of jobs recently that I never thought I'd hear back from, including one at an fun looking place that I won't name.  I'm a huge fan of gaming and have a bit of retail experience, being able to cope socially when I have a role and familiarity with what I'm doing. 

Lo and behold, over two weeks later I hear back from this company. They ask me for an interview over at the premises on Monday and I'm grinning ear to ear. However, I see this email a couple days before the interview slot. I'm already cramming for mock exams on Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday.  

I book the train tickets, research a ton about the company and the role of a game operator instead of revising, and the day before (now) I'm breaking down. For a few reasons... 

* stressing about the train. I can count the times I've ever been on a train on one hand and I've never went myself. I'm so nervous about the process - what platforms, where's the mobile scanner, what if I get stuff stolen, what if someone sits next to me what if I miss my stuff etc. 
* stressing about the walk. The business is a 15 mins walk from the station. Even using Google Maps I'm scared I'll get lost and for some reason my stupid brain thinks I'll be judged for walking down the streets in work slacks and high heeled boots. 
* stressing about a taxi, to skip the walk. Again  can count the times I've ever been on a taxi on one hand and I've never called for or got one myself.  Will there be tons near the station? How do I call for one? What's the etiquette inside them? Will the driver be dodgy? 
* this is a completely new area to me that's pretty far away from home (in my standards anyway)

So silly, I know, but I'm paranoid. 

I'm in an awful situation because my siblings are so proud of me for getting an interview, I've told my friends, and my Dad (begrudgingly) offered to drive me to the station. My Mum and Dad think I'll bail. When I said I'm a bit worried about taxis, asking for advice and they gave me vague answers, they asked me if I already booked the tickets and said ""just cancel it we'll pay you back"". I feel an obligation to myself and to my siblings/friends to go to the interview and really want to prove my parents wrong. I really want this first job and think it would be a good stepping stone for me. Plus, I can't let the time I spent on preparing for the interview instead of revising go to waste. 

Logically, now I'm so distressed and still awake in the middle of the night, I know I'll bail and it's killing me. I'll just have to email at 7 in the morning or something equally ridiculously unprofessional and make up an excuse to postpone the interview/do it by phone. 

I think I could've mitigated my worries and confidently gone to the interview if I had a friend escorting me to the train and to the taxi, meeting up to do things with me occasionally that required I travel in these ways. Perhaps they'd start out talking to the train conductor, calling a taxi, talking to the taxi person for me. Then we'd progress onto me trying out those things with them in tow. After having done this, I reckon I could tackle any journey by myself confidently. 

Obviously the night before I'm screwed. I have to bail, my brain is going haywire and I feel like an elephant  stepped on my chest. But I'd really like to prevent this sort of situation in the future and learn how to travel. **Is there a buddy system to equip people with autism/social anxiety (I'm not sure if I just have the latter or both) with unfamiliar social situations like travelling?

I was off work since semester 2 of last year (I've been working part time job as a server at a cafe and I am a uni student studying full time), because I told my boss that I wanted to focus on my studies. They were kind enough to let me be off work while not being fired, and they told me to keep the uniform with me so I could continue working after my sem 2 ends. 

Sem 2 ended, and holidays started but I was again unable to work during the holidays for personal reasons so I told my boss about this. My boss asked if i'd wanna come back to work after and I said I would, so I still kept my uniform with me. 

So I'm still off work but now I decided that I don't want to work there anymore. And I feel so guilty about it. I was literally the worst employee there. I couldn't properly led customers into the cafe because I had a hard time greeting customers. One time I even spilled a drink all over a customer and in her expensive, luxury bag and shoes. That day I felt so devastated and thought my life would end. I just felt so sorry to my boss and the customer because I put the customer in danger, let their cafe's reputation down and obviously we had to pay for the cost of refund. But my boss didn't even make me pay anything and they covered all the bill. Even after that incident, they didnt even fire me. They said they understand that it was a mistake. They were so understanding, and I felt so thankful yet guilty and overwhelmed because I had to kind of give something back to them by working harder or something... but I reflected over the holidays, and I just thought that I don't want to work there anymore. As I said earlier, I was the worst employee there so everyone around me probably hated me cuz I probably wasn't doing the job properly. Also thanks to my social anxiety I was never able to befriend with any of the people there because I never initiated conversations and I felt so tense and nervous and anxious in every social interactions. I just felt like a burden working there. My self esteem plummeted while working there because it made me be more aware that I am not able to live a normal fucking life because of my social anxiety.

So im just crying right now because of guilt and my inability of keeping a job as a server. I just feel so sorry to my boss because I feel so irresponsible for quitting the job regardless of their generosity and kindness. I dont know how i'll say i quit. Why can't I just be like a normal person who could just straight up talk to the boss i quit and walk away with a smile on my face? 

After I quit this job I'll need to find another job becuase my mum is keep pressuring and shaming me for not having a job and earning money like other ""normal"" people at my age, going outside, hanging out with other people... I just want to blurt my situation out to my mum about my social anxiety, but I'm afraid that she might think that it's her fault for me ended up being a socially inept person. But it really is my own fault and my stupidly wired brain. I really want to overcome social anxiety. All I want is   
 to just live like a normal fucking person. I am socially anxious not only at work but also at university and between friends, relatives and at hair salons, dentists, restaurants...  idk what to do with life. I feel like a complete failure in life. I want to do therapy but idk where to start from.. idk how to tell my boss i quit..

Im in my 40s now, so I feel you but I'm ahead of you and have some experience to share.

You probably talk to girls way more than I ever had the juevos to. In college I was a D1 athlete at a Pac12 university, and then I somehow became friends with all the cool kids at the university. Still, I was terrified of girls.

I thought some of them were attracted to me. But my internal critic would not allow it.

Here is an idea, if you go out in a social setting use the following: The Two Look Rule. If you make eye contact with a female, then after you both look another direction and you make eye contact again ... then (and this is why its called a ""rule"") you MUST try to talk to her. 

She may have accidentally looked your way a second time, but the odds of that are low. So if you want to try initiating communication with girls when you feel uncomfortable about it, at least we can narrow the odds in your favor.

Here is some more sage advise that cannot go wrong:  go for it!

If you don't go for it, okay. Don't beat yourself up. I spent many years wanting nothing more than to have someone to love, cuddle with and build a life together. I married a girl whose friend asked me to dance with her friend. 

To this day, I have never asked a girl out on a date. Not proud of that. You should not want that. But you also should not dwell and despair about it.

The publication grabbed some moderate attention from the community and to my suprise, I have even received some hopeful feedback and support from at least 3 or 4 users in my DMs. I would like to express gratitude for your efforts to run away from suffering, at least for some time. 

But still, things weren't that easy in general. It is impossible to throw away one event from head that happened even before I came up with an idea to start writing ""Not fitting in"".

Yeah, you are not mistaken: I am not sure how it is going to happen but I don't think I will live for long. 
Fine, it may sound controversial at first glance and the mind sometimes is deceptive.

But I was shocked when a week later in the streets I met an aquintance I haven't seen for a while. He remembers me as being melancholic and into dark humor but when he said ""oh, it's great to see you alive and it's great you haven't killed yourself yet"", I got haunted by his phrase.

It left me speechless for a moment but I succesfully  masked my grief to words he said. We haven't talked much in general after as we were walking in different directions and day later, that situation brought me back memories from the beginning of the year.

It seems that the task is clear: to fulfill his words. Though it looks bizzare, why not to try so?

As for what your aquaintance said, his words don't define you. You heard his words and let them haunt you longer than necessary, yet you come here for people to tell you not to suicide. You have issues with rumination. You experience painful things and prolong them in your head. You need to get out of your head somehow; staying busy, mindfulness, seeing a therapist, etc... Also, to make your writing make sense, there needs to be some kind of awareness of this character's ideas, deeper thoughts, and motivations.

Its totally frustrating. Your feelings of frustration are totally valid. And I'm not just blowing smoke, I have been dealing with the very same feelings for at least a couple of decades (I'm in my 40s).

You don't have to do anything, but I can ask you to do me a favor:

* Come to grips with that feeling that everyone ""dislikes"" you. Not possible because everyone disliked me first. =) You are not universally disliked. You may feel that way, and whatever you feel is (unfortunately sometimes) as real as any object you can set your hands on. Feelings can suck sometimes.
* Those voices can be scary. Mine tells me to solve social discomfort by drinking alcohol. DON'T DO THAT. I  can almost recite the voices doing battle in my head: ""fix this yo, just a couple glasses"" vs. ""oh no, fuck that bro ...""
* Your statement about ""other thoughts"" concerns me. I mean it when I say this: If no one else cares, I do. 
* I strongly recommend seeking therapy. And I'm saying that as someone who resisted it for decades. There are no quick fixes. But honestly, just having to think about how to explain your problems, then actually verbalizing them to someone - once you trust them - is super valuable.

Stick in there. And continue to reach out for help in whatever way you feel comfortable with when you are feeling in a dark place.","t3_s4obrl","t3_s4obrl","socialanxiety","reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/s4obrl/at_my_lowest/"

I myself found this quote while reading Lithuanian intro of his book ""Fear and Trembling"".

It is my starting point to share how I feel and, I think, always felt. It never bothered me earlier even in my teenage years where I thought such thing is my path, however while suffering from quarter age crisis, I am not only still feeling misunderstood but I see that I can't fit in everywhere what's around. 

Though I am an introvert and I can't avoid being as an individual, I still believe that humans are social animals (like Aristotle said) and that collectivist action always win over vulgar individualism. 

Being in my room, I always dream about meeting people and going somewhere, however, when I am actually surrounded by people I often turn homesick. I can recall many incidents from the past where I used to join various social clubs to participate in activities but as the things went better I always turned my back to people I met there and went my own ways. Perhaps it is happening because I often think about my image (social class, hobbies, interests) while being among everyone instead enjoying the flow so it seems a fair reason why I can't fit. 

It is unpleasant to suffer from such thing where I see others fitting in and reaching their goals. It is bad news for me and it seems that I have lock myself in psychological ward or monastery until the end of my life. The sky is grey, the future is bleak and I can't imagine living myself much anyway.

I'm bilingual. I learnt my second language Arabic and that is my family language but I only speak in English because I'm too shy to even speak in fear of compliments and garnering too much attention. I still use Arabic everyday though, for reading important texts, religious study, and communicating with people online as well as helping them. And this is the formal Arabic. Dialect is a different thing so I guess that's why I'm not so confident to speak with my family in it because I can easily mix my dialect with too many formal Arabic words.

Now I am learning Spanish. Been procrastinating and having a hard time in general with languages due to my OCD. But I still want to conquer this language because of how beautiful the language is, as well as the humongous archive of Spanish memes.If you want to practice your language with others you could use apps like discord for example. It doesn't necessarily have to be a conversation via voice. Just remember, you are learning this language for you.
