I have a Generalized Anxiety Disorder which I take Zoloft for but most mornings I wake up pretty anxious. I know that our cortisol levels are highest in the morning and I’m trying to combat the morning anxiousness with journaling and exercise (running). Curious if anyone has other tricks that helped them?","Thank you everyone for the advice! It ended up going fine. I definitely was overthinking and worrying it. They were nice and welcoming for the most part. My boyfriend is great and understands so he stayed with me the whole time. I played games with them even though I was really anxious so I‚Äôm proud of myself.","https://screening.mhanational.org/content/how-do-you-treat-anxiety/"
"shqxlm","Is this an Anxiety-Thing?","I'm not quite sure if my problem is an anxiety thing or just normal or something else so I'd appreciate your input:

I started making online friends due to covid. I started playing online RPGs (like D&amp;D) to make friends and practice social interactions. All interactions happen pretty much through discord. There's one person I really feel a friendly connection with and like to talk to and message. But he seems like a very reserved person and I'm always initiating contact.
We've messaged for hours yesterday and the day before. So now I feel anxiety about messaging him again because I don't want to seem needy or bother him. I'm just not sure if he's too nice to tell me I bother him or if he likes to talk to me. I also can't ask him that because I feel anxious about that, too.
I don't want to ruin a potential great friendship. So now I'm kind of in this awkward state of checking my discord every 5 minutes...seeing that he's online and closing it again because I'm afraid 😭

Does anyone have similar issues? How do you deal with it ?","It sounds like dissociation to me. I get that sometimes, either derealization, where my environment does feel real or it just feels strange or dream-like; or I get depersonalization where I like I am not completely in my body. I think it would be a good idea for you to try and see as therapist so you can talk to someone about how you are feeling.","https://screening.mhanational.org/content/im-feeling-lonely/"

After drivers training my parents wouldn’t let me drive and so I had no experience. My  boyfriend lets me drive when we hang out so the only time I don’t get anxiety is driving to his house because I’m so use to it and the roads aren’t busy. However, I only see him around once a week. I get so much anxiety that I shake and I can’t breath when there’s someone in front of me or the back. 


Does anyone have any advice? Idk how to get over my fear, I feel like I’m gonna forget rules because there’s a lot or get in an accident.","You are going through a lot and I thank you for sharing this stressful time rn. The first thing I want you to do is breathe, it may sound dumb and redundant but trust me it will help you relax. Next thing you should do is analyze what about school makes you anxious, it could be the amount of school work or having to interact with other people. Once you found the thing that stresses you, try to address it. Create weekly schedules to help you stay focused and in order, talk to your teachers and maybe they can help you with anything you might need.

Heart attacks and death have always been my greatest fear. I haven’t been able to get to sleep without having a panic attack for around a month now, I always feel on edge in the evening and I keep feeling my heart jump out of my chest and force myself to check my pulse, hyperventilating over my heart skipping a beat because i think i’m dying. The more i think about it, the worse it gets and i start to get other symptoms like brief dizziness and what feels like a wind pain under my left breast. I’m otherwise healthy and i don’t get this during the day, but it feels like i have something seriously wrong with me at night when i’m either bored or tired. I’ve searched my symptoms up and I can’t seem to come to a conclusion, the internet just scares me so much more. I’m so worried about if this is just my anxiety or if it’s something more serious. Can anybody help me or maybe give me some tips on how to sleep so I don’t find myself breathing manically and holding my hand on my pulse all night? I’ve had trouble sleeping before over the same reasons but never as bad as this. Thanks.","Take deep long breaths.  In for 5 seconds, out for 5.

Thank you, I admit I just need hope","I was in a similar position to your boyfriend with my ex. I made a lot of jokes about her cheating to try and make light of my insecurities.

Ultimately, in my situation, it came from two places; love and insecurity.

If he didn't care about you, then the prospect of you cheating wouldn't bother him. That's certainly how it felt from my perspective. This was the dominant feeling always.

Insecurity, though, is a persistent beast and it chipped away at me. Backing me in to a corner where I felt the need to always make these jokes.

My relationship didn't work out, though it could have. I think one of the things that would have helped would have been really open and frank dialogue. Sitting down and talking bilaterally.

So to keep it kind of brief, I'm a 22 year old male. I spent alot of my teenage years kind of dicking around. I've only recently started reading and finding myself wanting to learn alot more new things. Until I heard that after the age 25 your brain starts to deteriorate/stop growing.

This terrifies me man. I don't wanna be able to not learn. I still wanna be able to understand and grasp new concepts. I'm a law student, and I really want to get into coding, but in like 4 years. I feel like I'm running out of time.

And it REALLY sucks because these past 7 months I feel like I've just been doing ""nothing"". This 25 year old thing makes me feel like i've wasted too much time.

Ik I'm still ""young"" but I just can't take that after age 25, everything becomes significantly harder to grasp. Ugh

 I'm kind of simplifying, because I know it doesn't really ""Deteriorate"". But the idea that I'll have a harder time absorbing information and just becoming slower terrifies me.","My parents recently got a puppy a few months ago and my sister (a 5 year old) was absolutely terrified of dogs. we did have a dog a few years ago that dog was big and slow and passed of old age. I think what happened is she adjusted to having a dog in the house and eventually came around. so a tip I can give is try not to force yourself to like dogs. if you have any friends that have dogs ask them if you can go over there and try slowly approaching the dog while the owner holds the collar also try a big older dog instead of a puppy.","https://screening.mhanational.org/content/3-steps-keep-your-mind-grounded/"

However, what I am hearing from these people is that most have had SOB that comes and goes, not constant 24/7. 

**Have any of you had shortness of breath that was** ***24/7*****?**  

**If so, were you ever able to get rid of it?  How?**  

Looking for some hope that I can fix this!  It is very hard to believe that this is related to anxiety.  FYI, I was never diagnosed with any anxiety prior to this symptom.  This is my ONLY issue.  It has been happening for three months now, out of the blue.   I am not scared socially, etc.  I am not depressed.  I am taking an SSRI (Escitalopram) only for 11 days so far, and only because my doctor told me it would make the breathlessness go away.  It hasn't touched it.

"shqwqn","I had this strong feeling that this will be my last year alive","I was relaxing (smoking a bit of MJ too) and I had this feeling - it wasn’t scary (I DO struggle with anxiety and I’ve been diagnosed with Bipolar 2, but I’m medicated and doing well now).
The feeling was more of an all knowing peaceful feeling. But I’m hoping it’s just my anxiety being sneaky?

I just FELT like this year is my last year.

I didn’t “see”/ know what was going to happen - just that I won’t be here for too much longer.

I’m a 29 year old, otherwise physically healthy female. I don’t know what to make of this.","This made me tear up! You are strong girl!

Should I see a doctor?","The times I haven't had anxiety felt like...having room. For me, when I have anxiety it's all encompassing and very suffocating feeling. It's all I can think about. It becomes my default state of being. I can't watch anything, I can't do anything, I just sit and feel awful and can't handle anything. So, when I don't have anxiety it feels like I finally have room, like I was cooped up or cramped in a small space and I finally got free and can stretch and move around freely. Because my anxiety is a constant barrage of ""something's wrong, I'm not okay"" and so when I don't feel anxious everything feels airy and breezy and open because there isn't a constant red alert going off in my brain. So, I think that's what people without anxiety must feel like all the time, without even realizing what they have.","https://screening.mhanational.org/content/who-can-i-talk-about-my-anxiety/"

I've worked myself back up to eating regular food but I still have a fear of choking. My swallowing had gotten alot better but I find myself really anxious and thinking about it before and after I eat. Is there any reason my mind would be running these anxious thoughts through over and over?

Usually when I‚Äôve experienced some kind of symptom for other parts of my body (like when I was younger and couldn‚Äôt swallow for like two months) and get it checked, it disappears almost completely when I find out it‚Äôs nothing dangerous. _x000D__x000D_
But this, I swear to god this is ruining my life. I‚Äôm skipping out on so much because of it and I‚Äôm almost constantly in fear. Eating magnesium can help a bit. Honestly for me what‚Äôs helping the most is knowing I‚Äôm not alone, that makes me trust the fact that it‚Äôs not dangerous. But honestly, I don‚Äôt know. Especially that it can just come out of nowhere, doesn‚Äôt matter what state of mind I am in or how anxious I am. I have periods when it‚Äôs easier and periods when it‚Äôs harder.

When I want to go somewhere, say the store , I just get this terrible nauseating feeling. I feel the burning and vomit coming up and I just retreat back into the house 😞🥚","Intrusive thoughts are not a lot of fun and they can be pretty hard to untangle yourself from. Mine have ranged from really violent things all the way down to telling people they're fat or yelling in the cinema. I've never acted on them and I don't want to and that's why they feel like they have power. It's the result of you actually acting on them that is scary. And it's more than just a thought it's a feeling that you really want to do it. Like others have mentioned it feels like a compulsion._x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
I haven't really been affected by them in a long time though and whenever they've cropped up it's usually been during higher stress times. Otherwise for the most part I try to make a mental point of finding them funny in a dark humor kind of way. If you think they're funny it really goes a long way to take the power away from the thought. _x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
Making them funny seems like a weird thing to do but I've got a technique that I learned in The Happiness Trap (Book) that worked for me when I didn't understand them and I couldn't deal with them._x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
I'm paraphrasing here but it goes like this: First imagine the situation of your intrusive thought. Picture it happening in your mind and then slowly transfer that image to a black and while television. Now that the thought is on the television mentally place some little cowboy hats on the people in the scene. Let the TV have some bad reception and you have to hit it to clear it up. If there's anything dangerous going on in the scene maybe just replace it with something silly. If there's a knife or something sharp maybe now it's a sausage. Just keep going through the thought and make it ridiculous. _x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
I believe they call it cognitive defusion in the book. It really helped me untangle from the thoughts and stopped them from affecting me. You have to keep practicing and practicing, each time the intrusive thoughts pop up make them silly and eventually it starts really working._x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
I had a suicide intrusive thought as well and I used to turn the word into 3D word art in my head and imagine stupid music and streamers. Worked a treat -- after a while I forgot I even had a problem with it because it just stopped affecting me._x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
Something else that's really useful is just being able to name the thing that is happening. When the thoughts pop up like you want to leave your SO you mentally make a note: ""Ah ha! An intrusive thought!"". In meditation circles they would say that those thoughts are coming from the Monkey Mind and they don't actually belong to you. That can also help you to name them: ""The monkey brain has given me an intrusive thought! It's the leaving my SO one, good joke monkey brain."" Even though it doesn't feel funny to begin with I found after a while it actually did become funny. As morbid and terrible as they seem you can make light of them in your own mind to liberate yourself._x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
Anyway that's a big wall of text but I hope something in there is helpful to you. And remember there's no silver bullets or quick fixes just hard work and practice. Stick at it and your mental health won't dominate you! You can do it!_x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
I thoroughly recommend The Happiness Trap. I would say it saved me from tonnes of turmoil in my life and there's heaaaps of other things that might help you in there._x000D__x000D_

i do get quite a lot of anxiety from knowing my voice is broadcast to the public though, because i can‚Äôt stand my own voice, at least i couldn‚Äôt when i first started making vids. now i‚Äôm kinda used to it, but it still makes me nervous knowing it.

as for streaming, i‚Äôve found it to be a bit easier than making videos, but that‚Äôs mainly because i get like 3 viewers the whole stream and that‚Äôs all. i‚Äôve had times when i‚Äôve gotten like 10 viewers, and thats usually when i start getting extremely nervous. i can handle one or two chatters, but 5 or more people actively talking about what i‚Äôm doing (and my bad game skills) can be pretty stressful. 

i‚Äôve been doing it for 2 years though, so i‚Äôve gotten more used to it over time. that‚Äôs probably the biggest thing honestly. if you keep at it, it‚Äôs likely that eventually you‚Äôll get used to the thought of other people watching your videos.

that‚Äôs mostly all the advice i can give. i‚Äôve had a few loyal followers that have stayed with me for more than a year, and they‚Äôre the real reason i keep uploading and streaming. hopefully you find some people like that who can keep you motivated and give you reassurance! best of luck!","https://screening.mhanational.org/content/what-are-panic-attacks/"

*I cant enjoy the same things I used to love to the same degree

*I'm over vigilant about sounds in my environment, which elevates my anxiety

My house burned to the ground in the middle of the night and we barely made it out the windows with the baby and two boys. My husband was burned but is ok. Then less than a year later, we were hit by a drunk driver at a high speed. Since these incidents, I am constantly waiting for something bad to happen. These thoughts have consumed me and I’m struggling to live in the present, because I’m so focused on what could happen in every situation. Panic attacks are often. I’m on medication, but I still can’t stop thinking and the feeling of impending doom is taking over. Anyone else going through this?

Very good observing your own emotions!  As you said, you feel terrified in social settings.  I don't think there's anything ""wrong"" with you per-se any more than there's something wrong with somebody having a cold and sneezing, if that makes sense?  Indeed, it sounds like you have these negative reactions, but those are just reactions and I think it would be really nice to keep digging into the cause of those reactions.  Otherwise as you said, you are not autistic, you are not fat, very short etc so I don't think there's anything ""wrong"" with you from that point of view._x000D__x000D_

I'm living in a flat by myself. I like my job and I'm pretty decent at it, it involves talking to loads of people which gets me out of my own head. For hobbies I play football twice a week and meet up with friends once a week.

I find the evenings after work and the weekends desperately lonely. It gives me time and space for my anxiety to build. I can easily spend 24 hours in a row without talking to a soul and I think it's really bad for me.

My anxiety has been building up the past two months and climaxed on Monday. I requested a leave of absence and flew home because I wasn't sleeping or eating anymore and was crying all the time. I want to go back because the job is good and I like my colleagues but I'm afraid.

- Muscle tension, weakness, aches and pains, cramps, muscle twitches, jaw clenching
- Chest pain or racing heart, heart palpitations, pounding heart, audible heartbeat
- Hair loss, particularly on the crown of the head (telogen effluvium)
- Body-focused repetitive behaviors - skin/scab picking, lip/nail/cheek biting, hair pulling, bouncing of legs or wringing hands, tapping fingers, fidgeting, etc.
- Fatigue, exhaustion, irritability, difficulty focusing, forgetfulness or trouble with memory, insomnia, nightmares or trouble sleeping, frequent sleep disturbances
- Headaches, dizziness, weakness, light-headedness, sweating or shaking
- High blood pressure
- Rapid breathing or shortness of breath
- Hot flashes or chills, feeling overheated or very cold
- Nausea, vomiting, gas, bloating, acid reflux, stomach or digestive problems including diarrhea and constipation, lack of appetite or increased appetite
- Weak immune system, often getting colds for example

Nausea and other digestive issues - cramps, the feeling you get at the top of a rollercoaster before the plunge, tension, bloating, constipation and diarrhea - are very, very normal symptoms of anxiety. Anxiety can mimic symptoms of IBS.

Why did we get along? Well ive had similar traits. Insecure and jealous. Poor self esteem and self worth, so i never looked at her as damaged like most would. I knew i was just as damaged, so how can i judge her?

Anyways, im addicted to self help now, so after i started feeling better about myself, i noticed a pattern of behavior from our past fights. After she cheated on me a couple of times and had a couple incidents on Facebook where she had inappropriate conversations with guys. Yes i stayed because i got problems of my own. Codependency i think?

My wife too craves validation from men, and loves to hear compliments like she is beautiful, or that she looks younger. But she also craves it from her female friends. If they stop texting her, she wonders if they are mad at her. She texts and phones her friends multiple times a day, and doesn't get why she keeps losing friends. She will tell me she understands, and knows that she overstepped boundaries, then meet a new girl, only to bombared her with constant messages.

She for some reason NEEDS everyone to like her. She hates rejection. Even from someone she just met. I remember one time she comes home from work, and tells me of a guy at work she just met, and added him on Facebook. I was like, ""you JUST met this guy! You don't even know him!""

Im still with her but have been pondering the possibility of leaving. Ive never understand the need to be validated and accepted as much as my wife needs it. Im also very introverted, so i don't have any friends, and keep to myself.

I'm living alone in a foreign country and it can be difficult to find suitable English speaking help but desperately want to resume ""normal life"". 

Well, lets talk about meds first.  I am not a fan of using typical mental health meds unless it's necessary.  They have side effects that can be problematic and we aren't even sure exactly how they work.  In a case where someone is totally hosed up or suicidal, yeah, no brainer put them on something to stabilize them and work on getting other treatments involved so they can ween off.  Most of us fall short of that so it becomes a personal choice on how badly it is affecting your life.  

Now when it comes to other professional help, such as a therapist, they can be a GREAT tool and there is no good reason not to use one as a mean to improve your life.  You can also do the therapy 100% online so you don't need to limit yourself to folks in your immediate area which should help with the language issue.  I've had probably 6 therapist until I found my last one which I have used for two years.  Not all therapist are made equal and not all are a good fit even if they are good at their jobs but when you find one that matches well they can really help.","https://screening.mhanational.org/content/i-think-about-death-all-time/"

I feel jealous but I truly don't know why other than that it must be anxiety related. I guess the best you can do for now is just be open and honest with eachother about your feelings. You can explain to her that it hurts when she doesn't trust you and she can maybe try to indicate why exactly it bothers her. You shouldn't have to not hang out with people as that just isn't a healthy solution. The one thing that can help is if I make sure to plan something with my friends or family when I know my boyfriend is hanging out with his so I'm not at home by myself because I know I'm sensitive about it but in complete honesty, as much as my boyfriend is an absolute angel when it comes to helping me with my anxiety, it is something I mainly just have to feel and work through on my own.

The more i procrastinate, the more anxious i get about the task. I become so ashamed and embarrassed because I have not completed the task, and it paralyzes me instead of kicking my ass into gear. This makes things get worse and worse until i panic when anything even remotely reminds me of the task. This sounds so silly, but it is a real problem in my life. I'm 20 and i can't drive because of this. I ruined my academic career and my dignity because of this. I can't do any of the things I want to do because of this. I get caught in endless loops of researching with no action. I'm a complete mess right now and I've let things get very bad. I'm so ashamed to tell people about my life because I can just feel how much they are judging how inept i am. Now when i start making some progress it makes me feel pathetic for some reason. It's like i just can't win and it's entirely because I can't get out of my own way. I'm so stuck.","You‚Äôre doing well, I‚Äôd recommend you go to therapy before taking meds first. You‚Äôll learn how to organize your life and the way you perceive things. You‚Äôre already engaging in exposure therapy which will help you a lot with getting over social anxiety and insecurities that get reinforced with depression, which is a great thing and you should be happy about that. 

This is coming from personal experience, I‚Äôve taken lexapro for a whole year and it didn‚Äôt do anything but numb me or make things worse. From my point of view, it‚Äôs one of the most useless and overly prescribed SSRIs.

Over the years, whenever I decided to stopped trying, my friends never bothered to reach out and the friendship faded away.

I have two friends now and...feel the same cycle happening again. During the pandemic and even as lockdown has gradually lifted, it was always me who reached out, initiated safe-distanced meet-ups and checked in on them.

Definitely have not gotten used to this because my anxiety is acting up and I know I'll lose them the moment I stop. But I'm so tired of trying. I can't convince myself otherwise that they'll realise our friendship has faded (or that I have disappeared). 

I do wonder if this is karma, that I must have done something so horrendous to people in my past life; this loneliness and perpetuity of chasing after people is my penance.

"sjrblm","Talking to my psych about going on Zoloft instead of Seroquel","So this past week my psych that I see decided he was going to put me on 25mg of Seroquel for my anxiety (mainly social phobia). He did not give me any time be okay with this, in fact I didn’t even know what he was prescribing me until he was on the phone with my pharmacy. 

Upon further research, I really don’t feel comfortable taking an antipsychotic off label for anxiety as my first medication trial. I also spoke to my grandmother about it (my primary parent growing up) and apparently my mother was put on Seroquel for her schizophrenia and did not have a good reaction to it at all because of a heart condition I also have. I mentioned this to my doctor and he said I should be fine because they will give me EKGs, however I am still just not comfortable. 

While talking to my grandmother about this, she mentioned that she was prescribed Zoloft to quit smoking, but it made a significant difference in her experience with anxiety and PTSD. I did a little more research and I’m seeing that Zoloft is not only one of the few medications approved to treat social anxiety, but it also is one of the easiest on the heart! 

I’m a bit nervous about talking to my doctor about making this switch, as I don’t want to offend him, he isn’t the greatest listener, and I find him quite intimidating (unfortunately I am stuck with him until I leave this program). Any advice at all on the best way to approach this conversation with him?","I found that doing that was a huge relief. It helped me not grow attached and them. The good ones will understand.

And at least for me it wouldn't be long before they found out I had something wrong with me. I know I am doing everything I can to get better.

Sometimes i would masturbate and moan dispite knowing my grandmother was outside not caring because i really hate her. However after i was done i would pretend to be having a stomach ache and hence the moaning. I am actually worried this was abusive. I didn't think much about it that time. But now, i don't know. Please tell me your take on this.","First thing I'd suggest is just some basic health maintenance. If you are a caffeine user, either quit or cut down, for me this had the biggest effect on reducing these issues. Likewise, try to cut sugar down, stay away from alcohol &amp; drugs, even pot, &amp; just eat healthy in general, make sure to sleep well &amp; to be active (not necessarily exercise, just going for a half hour walk around your neighborhood will work). After that, I find it helpful to connect with the natural world &amp; engage the senses, this helps get you out of your head &amp; into your body. For example, go for a walk in nature &amp; smell the air, feel the plants or ground, pet an animal, that sort of thing. These are all the starting point things I would recommend. If you are still really suffering, I would recommend reaching out to a mental health professional, or even the counselor at your school if they are good. I've personally had a hard time finding a therapist I connected with, but I found the book 'How to stop worrying &amp; start living' by Dale Carnegie very helpful. It sounds cheesy, but it's pretty practical advice imo.

When you find yourself feeling this anxious excuse yourself out of sight and breathe in for 3 seconds, hold for 3 seconds, and slowly breathe out.

I haven’t had so many stressors at once like that before. Last year I went to so many doctors (rheumatologist, neurologist, gynecologist, orthopedic surgeon, GP, cardiologist, pulmonologist). I had a chest X-ray, breathing  function test, 3 ECGs, heart ultrasound, 2 heart monitors for 7 days each, trans a final ultrasound, left breast ultrasound, thyroid ultrasound( few cysts not concerning), 5 blood tests different months always including CBC, Metabolic panel, Magnesium, glucose, thyroid, cholesterol, CRP, ESR, lipid, ANA, B12, B6, DHEAS, urine tests. 

I always worry about my heart even though I’m told I’m fine. I always check it when I walk around and get up from sitting etc. My resting can go down to the low 60s when it’s time for bed. When I sit it’s around 80s. 

I have been having so many symptoms since then and I still do. 

-skipped beat feelings every day(It happens randomly! I can have it during exercise, after exercise, when I eat, when at rest)

-high heart rate when I just get up from sitting walk around it’s in the 110s

-sensitive skin when I take my clothes off hard or rub my skin it’s just noticeable but not painful

-random quick head pains sometimes either side 

-tight upper back always cracks

-costcondritis left side tender always under left breast

I want to try meditation, but I don’t know any good ones to start with that really help with my mind.","Hi friend!

There will be those who don't like you just cause. And there will be those who will accept you just cause and won't be bothered by your flaws and quirks, even if you think they are a big deal. Every situation is a different mixture of these types of people, and trying to appeal to all will end up hampering your approach to achieving your goals. Some decisions are unpopular for a reason.

"skpbsr","What are some ways I can can control my obsessive thoughts about my anxiety until I become medicated?","I have recently started dealing with high anxiety stemming from obsessive thoughts about my triggers and (sometimes) my inability to stop thinking about them. I will be seeing my old psychiatrist shortly so I can start taking medication to help deal with the anxiousness, but any advice on ways to deal with this on my own for the time being would be helpful and appreciated.","I‚Äôve recently had anxiety over death and being old. Having to come to terms with life in the sense of, your born, you live, you die. Sounds quite abrupt and final but that‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been feeling. I thought I had accepted and come to terms with it but evidently I haven‚Äôt. I‚Äôve also been questioning the point in life, why and how it is meaningful; I always seem to find a reason as to why it isn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not suicidal, nor do I have ‚Äòbad‚Äô thoughts. I want to live, and have a happy life. I think these thoughts are normal, or normal to question and ponder at some point in your life. When we have anxiety however it is how much we dwell and revisit these thoughts, allowing them to take over our lives. I was on antidepressants for the majority of my life and I feel as if I was numbed to any feelings of ‚Äònormal life anxieties.‚Äô Like I expect everyone goes through it and now I‚Äôm off meds I‚Äôm being hit majorly by every emotion and feeling I missed out on, you know? Unfortunately I haven‚Äôt had similar feelings of life not being real, so I can‚Äôt share any ‚Äòremedies‚Äô or great words of comfort. I do know a lot of people do feel this way though, or experience it at least once in their life. I have experienced the whole out of body experience and feeling of detachment from oneself through anxiety however. It‚Äôs horrible and quite unsettling; you do question if you‚Äôre losing it. 
I think when we have these thoughts, perpetuating our anxiety, whatever they may be, we struggle with the horror of having to accept them as a reality, as we have realised a truth. And I think that scares us, we don‚Äôt know what to do with that information, it provides us no comfort, and we believe we‚Äôve ‚Äòjust gotta live with it.‚Äô I suppose we do, it‚Äôs how we handle the the truth and process it that seems to ‚Äòmake or break‚Äô us. How we choose to interpret it. REBT methods can be quite good for rationalising these thoughts, but they‚Äôre not helpful for everyone. I‚Äôm being pushed to take meds again, by family, but I don‚Äôt want them, I don‚Äôt want to be numb again. I think if I had someone to talk to and rationalise these thoughts with, put plans in place with and understand my thoughts and reactions to said thoughts, I‚Äôd be fine. Or at least be on my way to feeling fine... I know we don‚Äôt know fully what thoughts we‚Äôre having and how it really is for each of us, but I hope you‚Äôre doing alright. Know that you‚Äôre not crazy and it is normal to question life and death, it perhaps just isn‚Äôt normal how much we may dwell and allow our lives to be ruled by such thoughts. I‚Äôm sorry if I have provided zero assistance or comfort but hopefully you take something from this - even if it‚Äôs just knowing you‚Äôre not alone with these thoughts, others have them too.

Sleep is obviously needed for us humans to function properly. When you're tired, it's the body's way of telling you it needs to get some rest. It's not meant to make you frightened or scared of sleeping. Believe it or not, staying awake more means that people like us tend to overthink more and come up with worst case scenario disasters in our heads. 

So obviously meditation doesn't work for you. Have you looked into other sleep-inducing remidies like ASMR? I like to watch it before I sleep to help me feel more sleepy otherwise I'll lay there awake for hours. Or maybe listen to white noise? (rain, trees, waterfalls etc.)

I've been reading up on all these diet changes, life style changes, therapy, self help books and all that. 

But I just realized that I don't know if I want to be without my anxiety. 

I truly feel like its part of my personality now. The panic attacks, the mental and physical symptoms, the personality changes. I never rant about it to my friends, I understand that others really dont care, Im also really vulnerable and uncomfortable sharing about it.

I feel as if I've been scammed even though I know that it was probably an issue with one of the machines, but two of the books had the glue come loose in the same place and ruin the colorful protective page at the front, because I tried to separate the glued page from the cover part; it's now ripped in that same spot in two different books. I can't help but feel like I should've just let the page be stuck to the glued part and that now it's ruined and instantly devalued, if I tape it then the tape will become a permanent part of the book.

I'm not sure what to do. I feel as if I paid for new and got a damaged product twice. I wouldn't mind so much if I paid for a used or damaged product.

Not too long before this I also bought a used book on Amazon for $6 and it was labeled as ""good"" but it came with stickers inside of the book and when I took them off it inevitably ripped off part of the picture it was covering.

I feel like the entire internet is trying to scam me whenever I want to buy a book now, that sellers really don't care at all about delivering a product they said that they had. ""New"" or ""Good"" doesn't mean anything, just that it's not falling apart at the spine, which one of them bought new is actually falling off the spine but it was on sale for the incredible amount of printing errors others complained of...

"sl7tyy","Psychiatrist Prescribing Questionable Medication (PLEASE HELP!!)","Good day friends, I would like some advise regarding my treating psychiatrists’ unusual choices with medication. (Keep in mind, I have NEVER used illicit substances, and have no history of alcohol abuse)

For some context, I’m diagnosed with all anxiety disorders, and MDD.
I’m on a high dose of Zoloft to combat this, but due to the response only being partial, psychiatrist has added 100mg Seroquel (IR) at night which he claims is to augment the anti-anxiety effect of Zoloft. 
This causes me to doubt what his logic is. He is clearly avoiding minor-tranquillisers as my PRN, and on top of the 100mg Seroquel, he wants me to take 25mg as needed during the day when the anxiety demands it. 

The potential side effect profile of anti-psychotic medication is on par and arguably worse than benzodiazepines, and the current Seroquel dosage is a total joke to claim ‘Anti-anxiety’. He tries pushing his idea that it ‘increases’ Dopamine.

I wasn’t born yesterday, and I do my research. At this dose, all it’d be doing is acting as an antihistamine, and maybe an ever so slight balancing of SERT and DAT. Granted, the antihistamine effect can help a bit with being nervousness and agitated, but it’s offensive being told to take it for my chronic and crippling panic disorder. All it will do is cause strong sedation. My psychiatrist has over 15 years of experience and is a consultant psych, and this fact makes his prescribing behaviour even more unusual.","Hello. I am sorry that you have to experience this. It really does sound tough.

If worst comes to worst and you feel a panic attack coming on again, take a Benadryl if you have access to it. It‚Äôs an antihistamine and will calm you down and make you tired / put you to sleep. You can get it OTC at any local pharmacy.



Now for the future - begin journaling, try to figure out what your triggers are. See a therapist if you can afford it, this will be the biggest ROI in terms of mental health.

If you trust yourself, go to a doctor and ask for a benzo, as long as you don‚Äôt abuse them you have no risk of addiction.

But my parents noticed me and decided they would talk to me about it. I wish they hadn’t it just kinda cemented the whole incident as 100% real and i really just walked in on my dad violating my mother. To make things worse when i was crying into my pillow about it, my dad just kinda laughed it off like “haha how unfortunate oh well” and this night still haunts me almost a decade later(I’m 20 now). And honestly i think is the direct cause of my sexual anorexia.(pretty much where i try to avoid any kind of sexual contact, regardless of how much i crave it) i am also horrified of initiating any kind of sexual contact, my ex thought i didn’t find her attractive because i always shot down any attempts she made at any advances. Anyway its been debilitating and I’m wondering if theres any way to cope with this so i can finally have a normal relationship with someone for once in my life.

"sm6iq0","Anxiety or something else?","Hi, been reading this sub a bit after leaning recently the pounding in my chest is something called a panic attack!

Back in early December I was going through a stressful period changing jobs and fainted unexpectedly, everything seemed to be ok but I started to worry about what the meaning of it was as it hadn't happened before. Next day I get an eye strain making my worry worse then the day after that I had reduced sensation in some parts of my face (same area both sides) which triggered a full on panic attack. Tests showed my blood and circulation to be fine so I put it out of my mind but I kept thinking about the fainting and face numbness and googled it, big mistake. Was on edge but sleeping ok over Christmas but had developed a sinus infection and my eyes were constantly tired, then in mid Jan I developed tinnitus in my left ear, common for sinus problems. but I noticed that when I got panicked it would get so much louder. Sinus infection mostly cleared up with antibiotics but the tinnitus is still with me, albeit much reduced. The face numbness comes and goes quite quickly so I don't panic from it now but still worried. Anew thing started on Friday where my eyes became very dry and burning that had me in a bit of a panic again, been treating it with eye drops and warm compress which is helping but I also notice what felt like temporary reduced sensation in my eyes. it clears up quickly but scared the life out of me.
Never had anything like this before December last year so don't know if I'm just stressed out or genuinely sick, any advice is appreciated!","Happy birthday dude.

"slqkhv","Do I have anxiety?","Lately i’ve been feeling a lot worse. Mostly because of nausea, its been hard to do things. I’ve looked online, and a lot of my issues point to me having anxiety, but i’m not sure.

Symptoms:

Constant nausea: my nausea is not always severe, but its always there in the background, even when im completely focused on something else.

Loss of appetite: i have been struggling to eat, mostly because of nausea, but also because i dont feel hungry much anymore.

Air hunger: my stomach often feels empty, even though it never rumbles like when its actually empty

These are the only symptoms i have, which is why im skeptical this is anxiety. I dont have trouble breathing, i dont sweat, etc. I’ve also never felt this much nausea before, even during stressful events in the past, it went away quickly.","It always gets better.

When my anxiety was at the worst and I was feeling all types of scary physical at symptoms I use to believe that they were something underlying or that I had something far more serious when in reality it wasn‚Äôt the case but even after I got over my health anxiety I still had that fear of death and I mean of course everyone fears death but we all fear it differently. Just know that you‚Äôre perfectly healthy and fine and it‚Äôs just our anxiety trying to play games with us and make us believe that we have the worst case scenario. Also, if you are just afraid of death in general well, what‚Äôs helped me was realizing that when that time comes it‚Äôs sort of like a finish line I guess. Of course I‚Äôm not saying go hurt yourself or anything or put yourself in harms way and of course I wouldn‚Äôt risk my life or do anything stupid but don‚Äôt fear something that may never come. Yes it‚Äôs scary when you hear people get killed or come down with a deadly sickness but you have to realize that it‚Äôs not something that we have control over. Death shows up un-attended sometimes but that doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre going to have the worst luck. With anxiety it‚Äôs just common that we become paranoid with our health and life but what truly helps me find relief was hearing this story of Kevin smith explaining how he essentially was on his death bed( obviously he survived to tell it but he didn‚Äôt know at the time) he explained how he felt oddly at peace. Like, every worry he had just went away because well, he was dealing with something else but it changed me perspective on death a bit because I never really thought about how kind of oddly satisfying it would be to say ‚Äúthis is it‚Äù. Like I said , don‚Äôt put yourself in harms way or do things that would I‚Äôm just saying that once you just picture it as this finish line then it kind of comforts you. Hopefully that helps, I‚Äôm not sure if I said what I wanted to say I feel like I have just so many things when talking on this subject but just remember we can‚Äôt always be fearful our whole lives for something that‚Äôs not gonna happen anytime soon ‚ù§Ô∏è","https://screening.mhanational.org/content/i-think-about-death-all-time/"

There are some points where it hurts so bad that I can’t focus on my whatever school work I am doing. I also tend to sweat a lot even when I don’t think I’m necessarily nervous. But when I am, I sweat a ton. Like my hands are always clammy and I refuse to wear any type of fitted tshirts because I just sweat through them. Also, whenever I do my schoolwork I start getting anxious and a really bad migraine comes in. It’s like one of those tension headaches. There are also times where I feel my throat close up and it’s hard to control my breathing. I also get really hot hot or cold at times when I’m nervous for no reason.

_x000D__x000D_
One thing I‚Äôd really recommend you listening to is Marisa Peer‚Äôs ‚ÄòI Am Enough‚Äô meditation on YouTube. It‚Äôs a meditation that helps to raise self esteem. I‚Äôve been listening to it for a while now and it is comforting. It is true that with repetition your mind will absorb the affirmations you tell it. Sometimes they‚Äôll feel false or weird to say at first, but stick with them. With time the belief will become second nature. _x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
One piece of advice I‚Äôd like to give you is to try and stop skipping class. I‚Äôve just finished school myself, and when my anxiety reached an all-time high at the end of last year/beginning of this year, all I wanted to do was avoid it. This was because I‚Äôd had a panic attack in class, which resulted in my mind subconsciously viewing school as a threat. I learned in therapy that although avoidance does decrease anxiety in the short term because the ‚Äòthreat‚Äô is no longer present, it actually increases it in the long term because by avoiding class, you‚Äôre basically reinforcing this idea that ‚Äòclass is a threat‚Äô in your mind. I know the anxiety can be so overwhelming, it took a lot of persistence for me to be able to go to my classes again and feel relaxed. But I did do it. Right before lockdown I was the happiest I‚Äôd been in ages. _x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
Lastly, I really recommend reading the book ‚ÄòOvercoming Social Anxiety‚Äô by Tobias Atkins. He gives some really good advice on how to deal with this anxiety as he‚Äôs been through it himself. This book really made me feel less alone._x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
Hang in there, I know how you feel and it can be really tough. But this is not a life sentence.

With the stuff above, I KNOW I shouldn't be too overly worried about it, but it feels like I can't control it, and any advice I've gotten before boils down to either ""don't worry about it "" or ""There's nothing you can do, stop being stupid"" kind of vibes.

I acted really dumb, cares only about my appearance and looking hot/being popular, all because I just wanted fo be accepted and have friends. It kinda worked but it also led me to a lot of toxic/abusive relationships and friendships. Finally by the end of highschool I had fixed everything myself and had a solid group of friends I actually liked and trusted, and I went to university and a had great first year making more friends ect. Things started to fall apart in second year tho (when I was 20) as my friendship with my closest best friend broke apart for a variety of reasons, i was in (another) shitty toxic relationship, and things just went down hill. Then i moved abroad to a whole new continent for university and again, I struggled so much with caring by that point about connecting with people and making friends, largely due to the trauma of how things had fallen apart in second year and also because I just started realizing I don‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù anyone, I like being alone and doing my own thing. I guess I am and always have been an aloof and introverted person, I just sometimes ‚Äúpretended‚Äù not to be for validation/ego ect.

My partner always brings me to all the parties and he introduces me and encourages me to make friends with all the people there, but I just don‚Äôt have it in me rn. No one really clicks and even if they did, I don‚Äôt know if I have the emotional energy to connect with friends and do things like that. Again, I do really enjoy spending my free time (when i‚Äôm not with my partner or doing school work) chilling by myself, getting high watching shows or writing or reading or whatever,  but then i feel so weird for this being my life. And maybe sometimes I am lonely, if only because my partner always has so many things going on, like he‚Äôs in tons of group chats and societies and has people always messaging him, and then there‚Äôs me LOL. 

Sorry I realize this post is about your issues, didn‚Äôt mean to rant so long. Just thought I‚Äôd let u know that there is someone out there with similar feelings about everything. I can‚Äôt really give u advice because I don‚Äôt know how to ‚Äúremove the barrier‚Äù myself yet, in fact in the last year I‚Äôve probably done the opposite-I don‚Äôt really use my personal social media anymore, I don‚Äôt reach out to many people, I‚Äôve lost a few of my friends back home due to drama/drifting apart, and at parties I mostly stand there and smile as my partner takes center stage-it reminds me of my good old days back in first year uni but it‚Äôs just not for me anymore. Like you, I‚Äôm also just a good-grades producing robot most of the time now, and I think I‚Äôm actually okay with that. I keep telling myself eventually things will change (like post-COVID) and I am looking forward to going back to my home country to see my friends, which will help. But yea, it sounds like you already made some progress by having a healthy relationship with ur bf and u made a strong friendship with someone who seems really interested in getting to know you.

This may have been asked before  but I can't phrase it in a way where I can find the answer I'm looking for. Like the title says, what I mean is if you feel anxious about x thing, say having forgotten your keys (multiple times a day even though you clearly remeber they are there) is it better to check and be like ""see they are there"" or is it worse as in like establishing a pattern where you only feel OK if you check ? The keys is just a simple example of a behaviour I have on many things big and small and I'm wondering if it helps more to ""give in"" and check or to fight off the urge. I spent the last day and half compulsively checking the stipend for a job I was offered in fear it wasn't what I understood, but no amount of checking (like with the keys) helps, so I had to email and ask, as so to have it written out in front of me to be more sure. I am still not 100% ""sure"", I have a meeting on Monday when that's going to be confirmed and until then I won't feel relaxed about it even though I already know that's it. I'm waiting for the ""eff you"" moment where something goes sideways. Anything I can do? Checking and or rationalising doesn't help in these cases.

Please any insight? 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻","I was hoping there would be a comment on this. 

As a boy, I used to love sleeping in while on summer break from school. The morning structure of mom waking me, or my alarm waking me, for school in the morning was now (finally) gone. It felt like amazing Zen to experience free, comfortable, cozy, and unencumbered sleep -- and waking up at-will or when my [something] gave me permission, or said ""it's time to move"", to leave my peaceful slumber. 

I saw nothing wrong with it. 

But my dad, who worked in town, had a routine of coming home for his lunch, every single day. His time was usually 1100, but sometimes it was 1045. And often, there may be a reason to swing in earlier for random occasions... And therein lay what became to be a problem. 

He was a good guy, with good intentions, but was none-too-pleased to find any of us still sleeping. We would often hear ""you kids ain't going to be sleeping all day"" or something about ""sleeping till noon"". 

Well, I'd say that's a cause of why I have no problem doing exactly as you, with later bedtimes (and still sleeping 8hr), or those exceptionally late nights being in flow and working on a project, only to feel guilty about getting those 8hrs, because my wake time would be somewhere around 1030-1100.. and, well, I'd be missing out on the World, wouldn't I? Being found to be sleeping, even under basic circumstances like this, brings me anxiety, and so I fritter away at other things to distract myself from the fact that I 'should' be sleeping. Or, I compromise and force myself to be active and awake even if it only gives me 6hrs. 

Sleep is personal, and I wish we didn't feel guilty for getting enough, or choosing to get a responsible amount at odd times of the day -- ie, short or long naps.

Possible Trigger Warning? I’m not sure if this is an accurate representation of anxiety. To preface I recently got promoted and I messed up big time at work when dealing with a coworker acting out. All the other guys in my section saw firsthand how I failed to handle the situation.

After the event, I immediately talked to my mentor on how I could’ve handled the situation better and what to do going forward. This helped with the stress to some degree. Looking back it probably isn’t as big a deal as I’m making it out to be but I was stressing hardcore over the whole ordeal.

I tried the normal methods of dealing with the stress I’m used to by going to the gym and smoking but surprisingly these methods just heightened the anxiety. I think at this point I panicked because my go to routine was failing and was instead increasing my anxiety. I was struggling to breathe normally and I immediately called my family and close friends which definitely helped. My breathing got better but it was still irregular.

Likely, the first thing a therapist will do, is give you some information on these. The techniques are all over the internet for free._x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
Its something you can do anywhere or by yourself. They teach you to achieve mindfulness, helping to reduce anxiety. _x000D__x000D_

It also replaces nasty coping habits like hookers and blow._x000D__x000D_

"smgqep","My best friend is giving me the silent treatment and it's making my anxiety so bad I feel sick.","Last night me (22F) and my best friend (22F) (and roommate) were planning to go out to dinner at 7:30. I was ready to go around 7:28 and I waited in the living room for her. She is finally ready to go at 7:50. I was annoyed because she has been running late to most of our plans so I confronted her before we left. I asked her if in the future she could send a quick text or just let me know if she's running late, because waiting puts me in a bad mood. She seemed offended and started listing excuses and sarcastically responded ""yeah... ill send a text next time.""

At dinner she was very quiet and short with me, and quickly went to her room when we got back to the apartment. This morning when I see her in the apartment she does not acknowledge me, talk to me, or look at me when I say hi to her. This is making me feel horrible and I'm not sure what to do. I thought our friendship was at a point where she wouldn't try to hurt me like this.","For me it was the other way around. Racing mind caused physical symptoms, such as loss of vision/extremely blurred vision, tinnitus-sounding ringning in the ears that dampened the sound of everything else, random twitches/spasms in arms/hands, actual muscle cramps.

I knew I was probably a little bit over but not the amount that they said, I still fit in normal clothes sizes and I'm not plus size by any standard. However, the thought of going to a gym - a lot of the people there are people from my university and in much better shape than me - is something I wouldn't mind doing but can't bring myself to do. 

It's not the knowing how to operate gym equipment thing, I've been to a gym before when I was 13-14 because I was starting to get stretchmarks, it's the thought of getting changed in front of people who are going to be much skinnier than me. And the fear of them all secretly judging me for being overweight. Everyone at my uni is so much taller and skinnier than me, and it just makes me feel absolutely terrible about myself so I want to get in better shape because I want to feel healthier and better about myself.","I know what you are going through good night sleep I try to do things very early in the am light traffic roll the window down let the cold air down try to avoid caffeine and sugar drink lots of cold water have it with you","https://www.verywellmind.com/cope-with-social-anxiety-at-the-gym-4125214"

- Weak immune system, often getting colds for example

Muscle tension is one of the main hallmarks of generalized anxiety disorder - one of the six symptoms required for diagnosis, actually. It manifests in painless twitches or spasms, cramps and soreness. When you are on edge and anxious, your muscles are also tense and prolonged tension leads to pain from the strain on your muscles - just like how working out leads to soreness. I have GAD but also lifelong cerebral palsy which means tense, painful muscles are my default setting.¬† These things may help when it becomes painful:

- CBD oil or cream

- icy/hot patches

- cream with lidocaine

- ginger-based muscle rub

- hot bath with epsom salts or mustard powder

- gentle, frequent stretches; stop when it hurts, repeat every few minutes

- magnesium, potassium and Vitamin D3 supplementation

Don't rule out a problem with your pillow or mattress exacerbating the problem, too, if it's painful for long periods.","https://adaa.org/learn-from-us/from-the-experts/blog-posts/consumer/health-anxiety-what-it-and-how-beat-it"

At first I didn't even realize it was my anxiety making me like this, but today I was just wondering why I was being so lazy and doing absolutely everything in my power to avoid leaving the house. For the past week I have avoided running into my flatmates, attending my lectures in person, going grocery shopping (because I ran out of almost all my food and have been living off of microwaveable popcorn), and so on. There are so many other things I need to be doing like studying and cleaning my room but my mind is so scrambled right now and I'm so exhausted that I just never get anything done. 

My other issue is sleep. I have essentially become nocturnal because my body is either too worked up because of my anxiety to let me sleep during nighttime or I actively avoid sleeping because I get horrible nightmares/sleep paralysis/hallucinations (I have narcolepsy). This causes me to only fall asleep when I'm at the actual point of exhaustion. It also sucks because I get super paranoid at night. My anxiety actually gets worse because I have this irrational fear that somebody is watching/stalking or that something terrible is going to happen to me.

I'm starting to be super restless and weirdly sometimes hyperactive, but not in a productive way. More like in a I can't control my body type of way. 

Please if anyone has advice on what steps I can take to managing my anxiety (i beg you please do not suggest meditation or yoga) and how to sleep despite anxiety that would be incredible. Also side note, I know people are probably gonna suggest seeing a therapist and/or psychiatrist about my condition, which I am planning on doing, but for now I just need some advice on how to get a little better because there is no way I could talk to someone with how severe my social anxiety is right now.

"slo05q","Handling situational anxiety","I have had GAD since I was 21 (9 years ago) and I dealt with it with meds, without meds, with therapy, without therapy &amp; it’s been the “usual” ups and downs of anxiety. 

Most recently, I was on Buspar/Buspirone for a 6-8 month stint in 2020-2021 when my SO of 4 years’ father was nearing end of life and passed away. My GP helped me find Buspar (I had taken Citalopram before and hated the side effects) and she and I worked on dosage on a month-to-month basis. 

After my SO’s father’s passing, a lot of my anxiety went away and my GP and I agreed that I could wean off and stop Buspar. She advised that my anxiety as of late appears to be “situational anxiety” (certain scenarios make my GAD much worse or accelerates symptoms) and recommended I keep my remaining Buspar on hand instead of tossing it. 

The past 3 weeks, I have been experiencing severe anxiety symptoms to the point where I took a day off work because I could not stop shaking or crying (I have rarely taken time off work for anxiety). I hate admitting when my anxiety is beating me and I don’t want to turn to meds again but I don’t feel i have any other choice. 

Has anyone else pursued handling situational anxiety without meds?","I‚Äôve struggled with severe, debilitating anxiety since I was young. The fear of my anxiety and a possible oncoming panic attack, or severely uncomfortable symptoms became all I thought about. It was almost worse than just having the dang panic attack. Alas.

Access to and financial support for essential psychological care is surprisingly limited. For people who have already spent all their energy mustering up the courage to make that phonecall to the hotline or talk to that receptionist at the therapist's office, dealing with the endless extra shenanigans required to see a therapist is like a slap in the face. It shouldn't be that way. Simple procedures for access to psychological support will save lives.

The narrative of 'omg I have to figure it all out by 25/30 and if I don't I'm doomed' is a throwback to a lifescript/culture that no longer exists, is not reflective of real life and is part of an ageist culture.

We're not rushing to get married off and raise kids in our early 20s like our grandparents/parents/etc. The sort of job market and society that allowed them to buy a house, work the same well-paying job right out of college/highschool and all that no longer exists.

When you see someone who ""has it all"" or achieves great success or fame at 22 or 25 or whatever you need to remember that they are the exception.

Most folks start hitting their stride and feeling okay in their skin/picking up steam way after that point.

I'm also gonna let you in on a secret that I'm only juuust figuring out (I'll be 30 in less than a month after 5 years crying and panicking over it): nobody ever really 'grows up' and 'matures'. You learn how to pay bills, feed yourself or whatever but thinking that you have to suddenly 'become mature' is just a lie. I'm beginning to realize that my grandparents and my parents and aunts/uncles/older cousins are still who they were decades ago. Just different on the outside and (hopefully) having learned things due to all they've experienced.

You've got like...what, another 50-60+ potential years on the planet? Try and remember that you're, in the grand scheme of things, not even quite done growing brain development-wise.

I'm 30 and I'm realizing now that I'm just graduating to baby adult.

There are no rules to this thing. We can make the best or the worst of it. I hope you make the best of it. I hope you see things that startle you. I hope you feel things you‚Äôve never felt before. I hope you meet people who have a different point of view. I hope you live a life you‚Äôre proud of, and if you‚Äôre not, I hope you have the courage to start over again.‚Äù

"snlmhf","Anxiety attacks almost every single night, makes me procrastinate sleeping which keeps my sleep schedule messed up","Almost every night. I don't know why. Seems to be a combination of things I've been concerned about in the back of my head, sometimes it's just plain fear of dying or something. It's not new, but since somewhere halfway through 2020 I also started awakening several times a night. Recently I had a good night where this didn't happen but I'm figuring out how to make that normal. Additionally, it seems to cause a constant urge to go to the toilet, some nights I can go up to six or seven times to urinate because the feeling won't go away. Double uncomfortable. 

Some days towards nighttime I also just start feeling too good and energetic which causes me to want to make this opportunity useful to be productive and work on things such as projects. This is another part of the cycle that makes me think it might not only be the anxiety at night, if anyone has any ideas here or has experienced something similar then I'd like to hear it.

It's tiring to constantly have people tell you ""just sleep earlier"", if it were that simple I would've long done it. But the thing is that I really want to get this taken care of and I want my sleep schedule restored.","Yes it‚Äôs going to be ok, because right now it‚Äôs already ok, it‚Äôs really about mindset.

"snrvak","How do you differentiate between warranted and excessive anxiety?","Sometimes it’s good and warranted to be cautious, like when in an unfamiliar area or when using dangerous tools. How do you tell when that warranted anxiety becomes excessive and hindering? 

My situation is that I’m in a new area and have become quite anxious about going outside, since it gets dark quickly. It’s normal to be cautious when going out alone at night, but when “night” is 6pm and the anxiety is debilitating that’s a problem. Another example is being fearful of a house fire. That’s a normal thing to be mindful of, but when it causes me to check the stove over and over and worry about it while I’m outside, it negatively impacts my life. These are some clear examples, but things can get fuzzy in any area and be less obvious. 

So how do you tell when something has crossed over from “this is normal to be worried about” to “I am worrying more than needed”? And how do you handle that or come back from it?","Maybe try a multivitamin for a month and see if it helps? Can be an electrolyte imbalance, low vitamin D, vitamin b12, low potassium, low magnesium, low iron.

I had this problem, too. The worst was my left eye lid was twitching really hard for a month omg. It was so annoying. I coule see it move in and out really hard. I started taking a regular multivitamin and it stopped.

Also, it could be hormone related.

"snomo6","Seeing General Practitioner for Anxiety?","So this past month I have seen two different psychiatrists. Both of these experiences have been absolutely awful from feeling like they don’t understand what my problem is, being interrupted when explaining how I feel, and prescribing me medication I do not feel comfortable taking due to a heart condition they are aware of. When I brought up these concerns, I was just told I am being “too fragile” or “it’s this medication or no medication.”

I have been diagnosed with severe social anxiety, however I do not doubt that I have another form of anxiety as well. This anxiety has made me unable to work, avoidant of any social situations (even with friends or family or over text), and I am constantly on edge making me irritable. I hate being irritable towards others, so this has made me isolate even more. I am completely put off at this point from talking to a psychiatrist. I’m not saying never again, but definitely not right now. Has anyone here ever been prescribed anxiety medications by their general practitioner?

Yeah, you made a mistake. Maybe you were just not thinking or whatever. But who cares? It's a silly, little mistake. It's so pointless that most people would've just said ""just bring it into the house"" and moved along. It's your *dad's* issue that he decided to react like this to you. It's not your problem that he got this mad over groceries. It's his, and you can't internalize his immature reaction to the situation as some sort of statement on yourself. After all, if he can't tell you how to do things in a helpful way (as you should with your children) then why does he expect you to somehow know things by instinct?

Idk what your dad is like, but if he's anything like mine then it probably won't be any use to confront him about how he talks to you, because he probably thinks he's right to call you names, and that he's doing you a favor. It might be a habit of his to treat you badly when hes upset. You just gotta keep thinking, ""not my problem!"" and remember that there are mature ways to handle things, and then your dad's way.

I’m flying to New York next week to see my long distance boyfriend :)) I’m very excited and have flown there alone before with no issue, but I’ve been suuuuper anxious lately and have started having panic attacks again, and I know the traveling will be anxiety-inducing.

Take your time to tap into and observe that feeling of anxiety and try to make out where it is located in your body. Your throat? Your chest? Your gut? After you have a understanding of where it's located, take a look at how exactly it moves through your body. Does it spin, swing or circle around? What kind of shape does it resemble? Does it move fast or slow? Is it turning into a certain direction? Is there a color you'd attribute to it? As soon as you got a decent image of that energy in your body, envision to pull that energy out of your body and put it about one yard in front of you so you can get a better look at it. Take your time observing it. The way it moves, it's shape, color and so on. While that energy keeps moving the way it does, imagine there to be a magic remote control in your hand. With this remote you can freely manipulate the energy in front of you. There's a play/pause button as well as buttons for forward and rewind, as well as different colors to choose from. Press the pause button and observe how the energy gets slower and slower until it finally stops. Now press the rewind button and make it move in the opposite direction. Make it spin a little faster. As a finishing touch, choose a color that's to your liking. Now look at your finished work for a few seconds and put that energy back in your body and feel how it affects you when the energy is moving through your body in this new way. Relish in the experience for a few more seconds. Now take 3 deep breaths before you start to check your emotional state and compare it to before the excercise. There should be a discernable difference. _x000D__x000D_
-----------_x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
If it feels good, repeat the excercise a few times in a row, while imagining the experience as realistically as possible. If there are known triggers, check the emotional response when thinking about that. Did the emotional feedback change compared to before? _x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
If you like this excercise, just keep doing the excercise 3-5 times a day for as long as you see fit. The best time to do it is directly before you go to bed, because in our dreams the subconscious reevaluates the experiences (internal and external) of the day - especially those that triggered strong emotional feedback and what we perceived during the last 60 minutes before we sleep. _x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
Our brains are generalizing thoughts and feelings permanently by creating contextual rules of behavior. Once set these rules seldomly change, unless we experience a different emotional feedback in relation to the data the rules applied to. They determine how we react to things we can perceive internally (thoughts, bodily sensations) or externally (what we see, hear, taste, smell or taste). Fear is just one of the many meanings our minds can give. What this excercise is supposed to achieve, is giving your brain new options of behavior under certain circumstances, creating a different response, by connecting your current perception to a different emotional feedback._x000D__x000D_

Aside from communication that has already been suggested, another thing to consider is to a physical activity together each week. It could be running, gym, tennis or anything that you both may enjoy, but preferable a team sport. Part of the appeal of doing especially team sports together is that you begin to read another persons body language and you'll have other ways aside from words to quell your anxiety. Its also a great way to be independently dependent for a while during the day. Finally, physical exercise is known to lower anxiety in general..so it may be helpful to you as an individual in the long run. Also, consider therapy if you haven't already. This sounds like a great relationship and you both seem to be mature enough to see this all the way through.

One final recommendation, continue writing relationship advice on reddit. I have often found that in giving advice while drawing from my own experiences, often makes me revaluate my own situation from a third persons perspective. So perhaps you may be able to better learn or see your relationship in a new light once you step back.

"so37k0","help a mom out?","Hello all. 
Tldr:  I am the mother of a 10 year old with pretty significant GAD. My question is, does your generalized anxiety disorder affect your executive function?

Backstory: I thought my kiddo was showing signs of adhd. I had her evaluated by a licensed psychologist, and was told that she has pretty significant GAD. And coordination disorders called to dyspraxia and dysgraphia.  She has since started counseling and occupational therapy it's going pretty well. One of her... I guess symptoms... Is that, when she's feeling anxious, she gets really snappy, short, and curt with people. We have discovered that it is because she struggles with executive dysfunction. Basically she is so anxious that she doesn't know what to do first, and this causes her to feel like she's backed in a corner and she needs to fight her way out. One of the reasons I thought she might have ADHD was because she can't seem to focus, but her therapist said that it's not that she can't focus on one thing, it's that she doesn't know where to begin and she gets overwhelmed. Does this happen with anybody else? How do you deal with it? Any tricks I can try with her?  I just want to be a source of calm for her.","I used to struggle so much with this (esp fear of the dark), to the point where i slept at 7am each day since daylight felt safer. Jesus. I seriously feel you on being afraid to even close my eyes. And the constant nightmares.. can‚Äôt even count how many times i‚Äôve been stabbed to death in my dreams lol. Thankfully the nightmares gradually became less anxiety-inducing and disruptive, i.e. less panic/easier to fall back asleep. 

Nightlights (warm tint, preferably) saved my ass. Background noise really helped too - soft music or tv playing in the background worked best for me, especially when I‚Äôm alone. I‚Äôve heard that whitenoise or guided meditations are helpful too. Of course it took time to transition between full room lights - desk lamp - nightlight - silence/darkness, and that‚Äôs okay. Gotta take whatever sleep we can get, right... haha. 

Good luck!! It‚Äôs exhausting and so hard to get any proper rest. Let alone during pregnancy.. I truly hope it gets better for you soon! Hang in there love.","https://www.succeedsocially.com"

"sp9jxv","Am I being overly anxious about traveling to Mexico?","It is sometimes so hard to tell whether or not I am being reasonable when it comes to something I'm anxious about, so hoping for some outside opinions.

I planed a trip to Cabo with some friends a while ago and have just been waiting to see how COVID is going to make the final decision about whether or not to go. With Omicron dying down recently I've been set on going, until I realized that you have to show proof of a negative test to get back into the US. Should have realized this before, but again I kind of only recently decided I was actually going and started looking into travel restrictions.

It's not that I'm so anxious about getting super sick. I'm triple vaxxed and I want to go about living my life. If I get sick then I get sick. What I AM worried about is testing positive and then being stuck in Mexico for who knows how long. I know a number of people who were triple vaxxed and still got COVID and didn't test negative for a week or so. I was only planning to take 3 days off work for this trip and since I've been recently promoted it would be really stressful for me to have a miss a lot more unexpectedly. I also have a jiu jitsu competition I've been working really hard for the weekend following the trip.

I talked to my friends about it and they're not very concerned. Two of them are teachers who have the whole week off and one goes to school remotely, so I think that gives them more leeway. To me it just feels like a big risk and I think I could have a hard time enjoying the trip knowing that I'll have to test at the end and not knowing what the results will be. For that reason, I'm leaning towards not going. I'm worried though that my anxiety is getting in the way of what could be a really fun trip with friends I don't see that often and I'm afraid of missing out.

Am I being overly anxious?","Hi! I‚Äôm a college student with an ESA for my anxiety, depression, and PTSD who has also not had a ton of luck with antidepressants. I got my ESA dog about a year ago and he‚Äôs the best decision i‚Äôve made in a long time. He‚Äôs very cuddly and helps keep my anxiety at bay. Before I had him I had constant daily anxiety, but now that I have him my daily anxiety is much less and I am able to calm down by petting him, cuddling him, or taking him on walks. He‚Äôs also pretty goofy and he always smiles as me when I come home which makes my day so much better. As far as money goes, it is definitely a responsibility but if you adopt an older animal from a shelter (1.5+ years so they are hopefully potty trained and less destructive) and do some basic training with it at home it shouldn‚Äôt be too expensive. I definitely think that my ESA is worth the cost and I‚Äôm a broke college student. For my dog, I spent about $500 upfront after adoption fees (kennel, food, harness, leash, food/water bowl, toys, treats, etc.) and after that most of the expense is for annual shots, other vet bills, food, and treats. As long as you budget and are prepared you should be fine. I will say that ESAs aren‚Äôt for everybody, but I definitely think it was worth it for me.

_x000D__x000D_
This is how you do it... _x000D__x000D_
------------_x000D__x000D_
Imagine someone has made a movie about your life and your fear(s) , which you are about to watch at a theatre that's been prepared solely for you. You get your ticket at the counter. You grab something to eat and drink and make your way to the theater. As you walk in you realize it's completely empty. You are the only customer today. Now look for a seat that's to your liking (You recognize it immediately because it's your favorite color) and make yourself comfortable. Is it near the screen, the middle or farther back? Finally the lights are slowly being dimmed and as it gradually gets darker, you begin to feel lighter and lighter, finally elevating out of your body and upward towards the ceiling, where you come to a stop right behind a huge steel beam, that's obstructing your view towards the screen. Try touching the steel with both hands. Is it cold or warm? Now look down at your body in that seat. Look closely at yourself from above and observe that body down there while it watches the movie in your stead. Now the projector is starting. First comes the classic movie countdown 5...4...3...2...1... The movie starts with that MGM Lion intro. It then plays up to the moment right before you'd usually feel fear when suddenly the movie stops and starts playing backwards really fast, like someone hit the rewind button, making the movie run back to the very start. You see the numbers 1,2,3,4,5 when suddenly a yellow rubber duck leisurely crosses the screen, quacking. Did that duck wear any underwear? If so how did it look like?_x000D__x000D_
-----------_x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
Start again from the beginning and repeat reading that text and imagining the experience as realistically as possible (first-person perspective, larger than life, near, colorful, bright and clear) for like 5-6 times in a row. Then check your emotional condition. If there are known triggers, check the emotional response when thinking about that. Did the intensity of the emotional feedback change compared to before? _x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
If you like this excercise, just keep doing it 5 times a day for as long as you see fit. The best time to do that is directly before you go to bed, because in our dreams the subconscious reevaluates the experiences (internal and external) of the day - especially those that triggered strong emotional feedback as well as the thoughts we focus on during the last 60 minutes before we sleep._x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
How does this excercise work? Well... _x000D__x000D_
Our subconscious doesn't differ between data that stems from an inner event (imagination/visualization) and that of an outer event, so imagination can cause the same emotional response as real life experience, if visualized in a very lifelike manner. You probably have experienced that numerous times already by imagining worst case scenarios in your head and getting the emotional feedback of fear. This excercise utilizes these fear-inducing subconscious visualizations, remodels and then connects them to a different emotional feedback. _x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
Our perception of time plays an important role in this excercise as well. All we ever perceive in our daily lives is time moving forward. It's like the ultimate rule. Life doesn't go back in time. So to our subconscious seeing our reality rewind is something abnormal. So it's trying to give meaning to the incoming data and by immediately focusing on something ridiculous like a yellow rubber duck wearing underwear (or not) the scene that once used to hold the meaning of ""dangerous or threatening"" (resulting in fear as feedback), suddenly gets connected to the meaning of ""strange, funny and somewhat nonsensical"", thus triggering the corresponding emotional feedback creating new neural pathways, so our subconscious mind gains a new option of behavior. At least that's the theory._x000D__x000D_

However, assuming it is only anxiety, your stress is overloading your nervous system which can cause these symptoms. The best thing you cam do is get good sleep (hoping your insomnia is managed), eat healthy, exercise, and practice relaxation techniques like meditation, mindfulness, deep breathing, distracting your mind with hobbies/TV, relaxing, calming imagery, etc. when nerves are stressed like it sounds yours are, it take time to recover and it may be several weeks, so be patient with yourself.

This is left field, not a doctor, but you could have an electrolyte imbalance that can cause twitching muscles, maybe try adding potassium to your diet (say eating a banana a day) and see if that helps.

However I don’t know where to begin. Is journaling a good step? I get overwhelmed very easily. How do I not feel that way?","First thing I'd suggest is just some basic health maintenance. If you are a caffeine user, either quit or cut down, for me this had the biggest effect on reducing these issues. Likewise, try to cut sugar down, stay away from alcohol &amp; drugs, even pot, &amp; just eat healthy in general, make sure to sleep well &amp; to be active (not necessarily exercise, just going for a half hour walk around your neighborhood will work). After that, I find it helpful to connect with the natural world &amp; engage the senses, this helps get you out of your head &amp; into your body. For example, go for a walk in nature &amp; smell the air, feel the plants or ground, pet an animal, that sort of thing. These are all the starting point things I would recommend. If you are still really suffering, I would recommend reaching out to a mental health professional, or even the counselor at your school if they are good. I've personally had a hard time finding a therapist I connected with, but I found the book 'How to stop worrying &amp; start living' by Dale Carnegie very helpful. It sounds cheesy, but it's pretty practical advice imo. Remember also, the world is in an unusually anxiety producing state right now, so having horrible anxiety is not a crazy response to all that is going on.","https://screening.mhanational.org/activity/overcoming-thoughts/?cb=1620781514054"

"soxqgr","Anxiety or actual health issues or both?","Hello everyone. I've always suffered from anxiety. Since the age of 14, it has grown worse. I've tried every type of medication, and I'm currently taking Klonopin and Lamictal. I see a therapist and psychiatrist. I talk to friends and my dad every day. Because of my mental health, I am unable to hold a 9-5 job. On the side, I do background commercials but may have to quit because I feel as though my body is shutting down. Smoking weed helped me a lot until it didn't anymore. Several months after my mom died from undiagnosed cancer, I began experiencing terrible back pain, shoulder pain, and crippling knee pain. I thought it was a sprain but it was nerve pain. Neither weed nor CBD helped. I can barely leave the house now. My symptoms include dizziness, muscle pain, nausea, twitching, spasms, low blood sugar, agoraphobia, cramping, genetic hair loss, neck pain, stomach issues, sound sensitivity, nauseous, and chronic fatigue, and I can't control them. It is so bad that the only thing that helps is sleeping it off, which is not a very good quality of life. Occasionally, I don't even feel anxious when I need to rest or have some quiet time. Even though I used to do all these things like party and hang out with friends before, I still had anxiety, but now I have the same anxiety and cannot function due to my health issues. What is the point in living like this? Because I'm in so much pain, I have to stay home and isolate myself. Nothing works and no one understands. My only medical diagnosis is PCOS, and I'm due for some MRIs on my neck and spine. Let's hope this is simply anxiety. There were elevated B-12 levels in my blood, and I do not take any supplements which can lead to symptoms like this. I try to take vitamins but end up feeling sick.","Hey, I'm in a similar situation (male, 28, thin, loves video games, generally bored with life/no sense of purpose, been finishing a master's degree since forever, haven't been in a relationship in 3 years because of anxiety (are we twins lol?)). I have been struggling with anxiety for 3 years with some good periods, some mediocre and a handful of bad periods. Here's a couple of things that I've learned that might be of use.

1) Have you tried psychotherapy? I think medication is helpful but it rarely is when the ''root cause'' is not tackled. Psychotherapy might give you better odds of finding the root cause of your anxiety or atleast know more about yourself and your insecurities.

2) Having dreams/ambitions is really good. I fully understand your chicken/egg problem. One workaround you could try is : setting yourself a moderately challenging yet achievable goal or ambition. For instance, training 3 times a week in order to get fit for military school. Or if that's too much because of medication, tone it down. Say 30 mins walk every day. On the same subject, sports/exercise is usually very good against anxiety, so try to be active (no need to go crazy though).

3) Watch out for anxiety/mental illness information circulating on the internet, especially personal stories like : I have X condition, my panic attacks can be described as Y, I'm always thinking about Z. I don't know for you, but for me reading people's stories regarding anxiety usually scare the shit out of me, because I can tell myself : if that person has that symptom while having a panic attack, maybe I can have that too? Which is a great way to boost your fear. Try to remember that everyone is different and we all have a different story, ergo different symptoms and conditions, even though we all suffer from anxiety.

hope that can help!","https://www.healthline.com/health/physical-symptoms-of-anxiety#treatment"

‚Ä¢ Palpitations, pounding heart or quickened heart beat

‚Ä¢ Abnormal sweating

‚Ä¢ Trembling or shaking

‚Ä¢ Instances of shortness of breath or feeling smothered

‚Ä¢ Feelings of choking

‚Ä¢ Chest pain or discomfort

‚Ä¢ Nausea or abdominal pain

‚Ä¢ Dizziness, unsteadiness, light-headedness or faintness

‚Ä¢ Chills or hot flashes

‚Ä¢ Paresthesia (numbness or tingling sensations)

‚Ä¢ Derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (feeling detached from his or her self)

‚Ä¢ Fear of losing control or ‚Äúgoing crazy‚Äù

‚Ä¢ Fear of death

If you have panic attacks, these things will help you take your focus off your panic and bring you back into the present, ending your panic attack a bit quicker:

- Count backwards from 100 by threes, write your name with your non-dominant hand or sing the ABCs in your head, but skip every other letter. This takes enough focus that it takes your mind off your panic and helps end the panic faster.
- Wash your face with ice water; this triggers the diver's reflex. When we dive into cold water, our heartbeat automatically slows, blood moves from the limbs to the chest and breathing slows down. We can trigger this response without actually diving into water. Washing your face with ice water should be cold enough to shock your body and break the pattern of panic. Alternatively, try taking a cold shower.
- Look for things around you: five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, one thing you can taste. It's a grounding exercise, called The Five Senses.
- Inhale deeply, hold your breath for a bit, exhale deeply. Technically [this is the 4-7-8 method.](https://www.healthline.com/health/4-7-8-breathing#How-to-do-it-) Inhale for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 7 seconds, exhale for 8 seconds. The length of time isn't super important, the idea is just to breathe more deeply as panic makes you breathe shallowly and lack of oxygen makes it much worse.

I’m a 20 year old female and my anxiety has been taking over my life for the past few years and I’m not sure where to turn anymore.

3. Questioning reality and our purpose

As I’ve grown up my anxiety has definitely manifested itself in different ways, and recent thoughts I’ve had have nothing to do with day to day activities/problems, I’m a successful entrepreneur, I have a few close friends, a wonderful family, but the things that have been crippling to my mental health are the bullet points listed above. I know every concept I listed is out of my control, no one will ever know, and maybe that’s why it scares and worries me so much. Sometimes I feel like I’m going crazy, that I’m the only one going through is. I don’t know where else to post this, so I thought here may be suitable.

I began feeling this horrible sense of dread, and I began to worry that I was having a schizophrenic episode. I have a great aunt with schizophrenia, and I have done psychedelics a few times as a teenager, so I began obsessing over those facts and fearing that my life is going to be ruined from getting schizophrenia, and I ended up having a pretty massive panic attack, the first one I've ever had really.

Both the brain and the GI tract have neurons in them. In fact, some in the medical community call the stomach the 2nd brain._x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
Anyway, the brain can send signals of distress to the GI tract and make the GI tract think it has to do something (like poop). Similarly, you can eat some food that your GI tract doesn't like and it can send a panic message to your brain and make you anxious._x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
So just to confirm: what you're feeling is real. But the need to poop, may be a signal from your brain being anxious (anticipating the bus, for example) making your GI tract think it needs to do something._x000D__x000D_

So, weirdly, it might be your stomach. Or something somewhere else in your GI tract. There's a whole branch of research about the bacteria that co-exist with you in your GI tract and how they also signal to your gut whether things are okay or not. Also, sometimes you can get the wrong type of bacteria in there and that bacteria sends unhelpful signals to your gut as well. _x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
How to diagnose that is tricky and most primary care physicians aren't super knowledgeable on the topic because the concept is rather new and still being heavily researched._x000D__x000D_

If you go to a doctor, they might try to put you on an SSRI, like Lexapro. It's a good drug, but I don't think it'll really solve your problem.

I started taking Paroxetine when I was 16, and that went well for a couple of years. Until 2017, things went to hell. In 2018 I switched to Escitalopram and I did okay again for awhile. But last year, April 2021, things went very very wrong. Without any reason I woke up in an extreme panic attack that lasted for days. And everyday since that dreaded day I've felt incredibly anxious. All day long, 24/7 pure anxiety. Every. Single. Day. Leading to multiple crisis situations and suicidal ideation. So far I've tried Paroxetine, Escitalopram, Venlafaxine, Fluoxetine, Clomipramine, Mirtazapine, Olanzapine, Seroquel, Abilify, Propranolol, and probably some other medications I've forgotten. Some as stand alone medications, some in combination with eachother. None worked. The only thing that does work is a high dosage of Xanax but you can't take that for life. On the therapy side of things I've had Psychotherapy, CBT, EMDR, Talk therapy, and exposure therapy. Nothing worked. I can't live like this, I can't do anything. I can't even cook or change my bed because I'm so anxious. Is there anything else that might help? Anything that might be the answer I'm looking for?","Ketamine IV or Ketamine nasal spray, they remove depression...also can be addictive so be careful not to use to often. Or try antidepressants?

Nothing has happened to me in April last year but around that time I developed a very high startle response.

"s7dyne","Constant brain fog feeling","I have been dealing with extreme brain fog that has been almost permanent for the past two months. About three weeks ago I had severe vertigo for a full week to the point where I couldn’t stand up without feeling like I was going to fall over, I don’t know if it’s related or not. That went away but I am still in constant brain fog feeling where I don’t feel real, I feel dizzy, like I’m gonna fall over, and it just doesn’t stop. I’ve already been to the doctor to see if I have an issue with my ears and my vestibular balance system, nothing was wrong. So now I have to get blood work done just to make sure that it isn’t a health issue. I do think it’s anxiety just because if I distract myself enough the feeling goes away until I remember that I’m supposed to be feeling it and then it comes back. But it’s debilitating.

I have this extreme fear of passing out or having a seizure. So this feeling makes me feel like I am about to have both of those things, though I never have. You would think that that would ease my mind with the amount of times I felt this feeling and nothing has happened, but every time I worry that that moment is going to be the moment where something happens. And it just continues. It’s affecting my life it’s affecting my job I’m literally sitting here thinking about quitting because I haven’t been to work in almost 3 weeks due to this feeling. My job is a great job, it’s full-time, has amazing benefits and decent pay. I can’t afford to lose it but I’m afraid. I do have a slight worry that it is a neurological issue but I don’t know. Today while I was typing, I forgot how to spell the word white and it scared me a lot because I’ve never been that clueless on how to spell such a simple word, so it sent me into an even bigger brain fog attack.

has anyone else ever experienced this? if so how did you get over it?","It is part of it, but there is more to it than that. What you describe is probably a very reasonable reaction to a very stressful situation, not *excessive* and unreasonable.

There are various assessments used to determine if someone has an anxiety disorder. If you go to a doctor or licensed therapist, they will administer or ask you to complete a scale such as the [GAD-7](https://www.mdcalc.com/gad-7-general-anxiety-disorder-7), [Trait Anxiety subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T)](https://osf.io/ke9jz/download), [Penn State Worry Questionnaire](https://www.midss.org/sites/default/files/pswq.pdf) and [Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)](https://res.cloudinary.com/dpmykpsih/image/upload/great-plains-health-site-358/media/1087/anxiety.pdf). There are several types of anxiety (generalized, social, PTSD, not otherwise specified, etc) and only a therapist or doctor could give a definitive answer, but this is the diagnostic criteria for **generalized anxiety disorder**, just one of the types of anxiety.

A. Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), ***occurring more days than not for at least 6 months***, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).

B. The individual finds it difficult to control the worry.

C. The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms having been present for more days than not for the past 6 months):

Note: Only one item required in children.

1. Restlessness, feeling keyed up or on edge.
2. Being easily fatigued.
3. Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank.
4. Irritability.
5. Muscle tension.
6. Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless, unsatisfying sleep).

D. The anxiety, worry, or physical symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

E. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism).

F. The disturbance is not better explained by another medical disorder (e.g., anxiety or worry about having panic attacks in panic disorder, negative evaluation in social anxiety disorder \[social phobia\], contamination or other obsessions in obsessive-compulsive disorder, separation from attachment figures in separation anxiety disorder, reminders of traumatic events in posttraumatic stress disorder, gaining weight in anorexia nervosa, physical complaints in somatic symptom disorder, perceived appearance flaws in body dysmorphic disorder, having a serious illness in illness anxiety disorder, or the content of delusional beliefs in schizophrenia or delusional disorder).

\- - -

And for **social anxiety disorder/social phobia:**

A. Marked fear or anxiety about one or more social situations in which the individual is exposed to possible scrutiny by others. Examples include social interactions (e.g., having a conversation, meeting unfamiliar people), being observed (e.g., eating or drinking), and performing in front of others (e.g. giving a speech).

Note: In children, the anxiety must occur in peer settings and not just during interactions with adults.¬†¬†

* The individual fears that he or she will act in a way or show anxiety symptoms that will be negatively evaluated (i.e., will be humiliating or embarrassing; will lead to rejection or offend others).
* The social situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety.

Note: In children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, freezing, clinging, shrinking, or failing to speak in social situations.¬†¬†

* The social situations are avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety.
* The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual threat posed by the social situation and to the sociocultural context.¬†¬†

B. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 months or more.

C. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.¬†¬†

D. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.¬†¬†

E. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better explained by symptoms or another mental disorder, such as panic disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, or autism spectrum disorder.

F. If another medical condition (e.g., Parkinson‚Äôs disease, obesity, disfigurement from burns or injury) is present, the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is clearly unrelated or is excessive.

\- - -

A **panic attack** includes at least four of these symptoms (as you can see above, panic attacks are NOT a requirement for GAD - **panic disorder** is a separate diagnosis and some people do have panic attacks, but don't have them frequently or severely enough to be classed as ""panic disorder"" - panic disorder also has its own criteria that must be met, which is as follows:

A. The individual experiences recurrent unexpected panic attacks, which are abrupt feelings of intense fear or discomfort that reach great heights within minutes, during a time in which at least four of the following symptoms occur:

* Palpitations, pounding heart or quickened heart beat
* Abnormal sweating
* Trembling or shaking
* Instances of shortness of breath or feeling smothered
* Feelings of choking
* Chest pain or discomfort
* Nausea or abdominal pain
* Dizziness, unsteadiness, light-headedness or faintness
* Chills or hot flashes
* Paresthesia (numbness or tingling sensations)
* Derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (feeling detached from his or her self)
* Fear of losing control or ‚Äúgoing crazy‚Äù
* Fear of death

B. One or more of the attacks were followed by a month (or longer) of one or both of the following:

* Persistent worry about having more panic attacks and/or their consequences (e.g., having a heart attack)
* A significant abnormal change in behavior in response to the attacks, such as ones intended to avoid unfamiliar situations.

C. The disturbance cannot be attributed to the physiological effects of a substance, such as a drug or medication, or another medical condition.

D. The disturbance cannot be better explained by another mental disorder, such as social anxiety disorder or specific phobia, which may involve panic attacks.

These things will help you take your focus off your panic and bring your back into the present, ending your panic attack a bit quicker:

- Count backwards from 100 by threes
- Look for things around you: five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, one thing you can taste. It's a grounding exercise, called The Five Senses.
- Inhale deeply, hold your breath for a bit, exhale deeply. Technically [this is the 4-7-8 method.](https://www.healthline.com/health/4-7-8-breathing#How-to-do-it-) Inhale for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 7 seconds, exhale for 8 seconds. The length of time isn't super important, the idea is just to breathe more deeply as panic makes you breathe shallowly and lack of oxygen makes it much worse.","https://screening.mhanational.org/activity/overcoming-thoughts/?cb=1620781514054"

So I've been thinking recently about my life, about how I became the way that I am.
I've been socially anxious and depressed for a long time, I struggle to make friends or even connect with people, despite meeting alot of new people regularly. 
I've been thinking about how I used to be as a kid... It wasn't this hard back then and I used to be way more trusting, optimistic and open with people. 
So what changed? 
Oh yeah, I immigrated to America as a child.

I'm not sure if this is the only reason why I have social anxiety, I believe it's a combination of this and other things, like moving from one city to another and having to rebuild my friend circle over and over again from the beginning. It just becomes exhausting at some point you know? 
I just wish to change and have stable, healthy friendships one day. 

But I'm wondering if anyone had any similar experiences throughout their life? 
It would just feel good to know I'm not alone.","I really understand what you mean with anxiety from the anxiety. I don't have it with sex, but with a lot of other things.

I’ve been suffering from social anxiety since middle school due to the trauma from bullying I endured all throughout the 3 years I was there + the toxic family environment I lived in. I’m now 18 and a freshman in college with no friends and no social life. Even at work it’s hard to make friends because I have to bare the burden of if I think they hate me and the constant feeling of self-consciousness. Therefore I mostly keep to myself. I’ve been wanting to seek therapy but because I was under 18 I couldn’t do it myself. My mom and dad don’t believe in mental health and think I act the way I do because I’m seeking for attention. Im usually the person who’s never involved in any social interaction, while everyone else is having fun and enjoying life, im wondering why can’t I be as happy and carefree as them? I hate feeling lonely, but talking to people fucking scares me. The whole point of me writing this was to see if anyone felt the same way I do or has gone through the same thing, and if so, how do you cope? What resources are available? Is there anyone I can talk to?","Sorry you are going through this! The fact that your worries are following you home from work makes it seem like anxiety. Whether or not it is something that is situational, i.e. you are unhappy with your current job and that is giving you anxiety, or it is a clinical level problem, may be something to talk to your doctor or a counselor about.

Also if i don't feel anxiety, then there is the problem of me not being able to express my emotions.  I feel numb.  So for example, I have to attend a wedding coming up and an office work party.  One side of the coin is crippling anxiety and the other is utter numbness.   I can't skip these events.  What do i do?  Going on a decade plus now and I can't shake this off.

I don't ruminate on worst case scenarios or anything and I sometimes have ""what if"" thoughts but swat them away easily. Mostly my anxiety is just that I think that people are thinking things about me that are entirely untrue. Also I'm scared of people judging me and yet if someone actually were judging me, they'd probably be unreasonable. So I don't understand how i can know that and still be anxious.

I face my fears but I still think people are judging me and am still anxious to do things like take out the garbage because I think neighbors will be watching me, and I'm scared to be waiting at a red light and have a car pull up next to me because then they might look at me and think something about me (I can't even name an example of what they would think about me). When it does happen and a car pulls up next to me I just look straight forward but am so nervous for no reason lmao.

But my social anxiety got worse. Lots of people are my trigger. And the big red store always has people. I can talk 1 on 1 but as soon as my brain processes more than a few people it goes full panic mode. So every day I’ve been “faking it” (without anyone knowing) but I’ve never “made it”.


I’ve always been the type to “power through my anxieties” and “face my fears”. Which I have been doing…. Every week for 3 years. But I’ve gotten worse. Just thinking about going to work tomorrow makes me sweat and want to throw up. I feel red throughout my entire body 

I hate this. I hate this. I hate this.

I took a shower, sat in the garden for a bit, then I took a short walk and ate something very small.

"rej2a5","How to stop feeling embarrassed over every small little thing?","How do you deal with memories of embarrassing or stupid things that you did years ago? For an example: right now I keep thinking about the time when I was in high school (almost 8 years ago). I loved giving people letters, whether to say how much I appreciate them, care for our friendship, will miss them after I graduate, etc. And now I’m so embarrassed. I feel like I was such a dork and my writing was probably so pathetic and flowery and just overall dumb. Even worse, I started getting anxiety that those same people will probably post about it on social media and share it. I know, stupid but I can’t help it. 

Has anyone ever felt the same way? How do you control embarrassed thoughts and forget about them?","Hey buddy. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre carrying so much undue guilt about this. The most important thing to remember is that you‚Äôre going to need to buy those pants at *some* point one way or another. If you keep wearing the old ones that don‚Äôt fit, you‚Äôre going to put more wear and tear on them than usual and need a new pair before long anyway. Even if you lose weight and start wearing them again, it‚Äôll preserve their longevity if you‚Äôre not wearing them now. You‚Äôre likely gonna save money in the long run.

Also, remember the whole ‚Äúput on your own safety mask before helping others with theirs‚Äù concept. You in a well-fit pair of pants can go out and donate your old ones to people who need them, volunteer your time, or do any other number of things to help your community.

"rekw08","I have absolutely zero idea how to correctly interact with people","I'm an (18m) soon to be 19 and ever since about 6th grade I've been painfully socially awkward. Because of this school was always awful for me, I know I'm fairly intelligent (at least according to state testing) but my grades have always ranged from bad to average with the occasional A, but that's not the point. 

The point is that I'll most likely have to go to college after this ""gap year"" I'm taking and I have absolutely zero clue how to talk to anybody, especially people my age. For some background, my entire last year of high school was online so obviously there's no chance for social interaction there. I've never gone anywhere by myself in my life, not any school events or extra curriculars either, and the thought of living by myself and being completely independent terrifies me.

It's like nearly all college students are extremely outgoing people and are probably very experienced socially, where does that leave me? I don't want to be a shut-in but I don't know how to do anything else. Even things that nearly everybody does make me extremely anxious. Things such as buying things at a store, taking a driver's test or working a job, all of these things make my stomach drop just thinking about them.

It was to the point that I was too anxious to leave the house for weeks and I had to go on a sick leave and subsequently because of my struggles, I left my job and started working for myself.

After a year, I started feeling a lot better, got to handle myself a little better, but lack of stable employment became a real problem - financially and mentally (I guess, I am not too good at looking for new gigs - 😬🤷). As a result, I decided to find a normal place to work. Big plus is, because of COVID, I am able to work from home which helps me with transition. However, as a junior employee, I am facing a lot of meetings where I need to prove my abilities (meetings to get on certain projects, job interview inside my job, didn't expect stuff like this would happen). Those meetings stress me out so much, that my mind goes blank and I forget half the stuff. It's been only two weeks and it makes me uneasy about my future at the company, and I honestly need a win when it comes to finding stable job 😅

I have moved and can't find therapist that I jibe with so I just need to know that things will be ok from someone that gets what I go through (unfortunately my family, with whom I am staying at the moment, can't see past my illness and just treat me as a diagnosis, not a human being).

Why?","I have no social anxiety in one on one situations (talking to people at parties, going on dates) I’m confident, and chatty and relaxed. It’s in no way a performance, I just feel totally ease and calm. 

But put me on public transport or in the middle of a city when I’m totally alone and I feel so self conscious. It’s like the more eyes on me, the more I get the physical symptoms of anxiety. 

I wonder if this is because when I’m out in public, people have the potential to be less than nice. They can be mean, rude, assertive, and I find this really overwhelming and intimidating.

I'm a shut-in and in my life I've never go outside alone, my sa is very severe and thinking about travelling is already making me very nervous, I actually wanna go but at the same time I dont want to, I'm also scared to reject them.   
They are going on 23rd December, thank you for your response in advance.","i mostly do streaming now but i used to make videos often and it really depends on the kind of video. i‚Äôve made gaming and commentary videos, the former of which id consider to be a lot easier, but it depends. gaming is only easy for me because i get lost in the gameplay and forget about the fact that this is being uploaded to the internet. then when i actually go to upload it, i do get some anxiety, but basically the same amount i would get from posting on reddit.

i do get quite a lot of anxiety from knowing my voice is broadcast to the public though, because i can‚Äôt stand my own voice, at least i couldn‚Äôt when i first started making vids. now i‚Äôm kinda used to it, but it still makes me nervous knowing it.

as for streaming, i‚Äôve found it to be a bit easier than making videos, but that‚Äôs mainly because i get like 3 viewers the whole stream and that‚Äôs all. i‚Äôve had times when i‚Äôve gotten like 10 viewers, and thats usually when i start getting extremely nervous. i can handle one or two chatters, but 5 or more people actively talking about what i‚Äôm doing (and my bad game skills) can be pretty stressful. 

i‚Äôve been doing it for 2 years though, so i‚Äôve gotten more used to it over time. that‚Äôs probably the biggest thing honestly. if you keep at it, it‚Äôs likely that eventually you‚Äôll get used to the thought of other people watching your videos.

that‚Äôs mostly all the advice i can give. i‚Äôve had a few loyal followers that have stayed with me for more than a year, and they‚Äôre the real reason i keep uploading and streaming. hopefully you find some people like that who can keep you motivated and give you reassurance! best of luck!","https://www.verywellmind.com/tips-for-managing-public-speaking-anxiety-3024336"

"rl94rr","Leaving an old school group chat?","I (21, M) was often bullied during high school (and middle school). I've left the group chat of middle school class since half a decade ago and now I have urge to leave the high school one.

You know, a bully bullied me and other classmates **laugh at me** being bullied as if enjoying it as some sort of entertainment. 

But at the same time I don't want to not have ""friends"". You know, being seen as if I look like a guy who ""is alone and always avoid people because he hate people"" in the eye of other potential people that would become my friends or girlfriend, or be seen as someone is who is too sensitive.

Do I overthink it? Should I just leave that group chat?

The group chat has many members who you can think of as ""regular normies"" (I mean normies in terms of personality and behavior who are mostly extrovert who make insensitive jokes, doesn't mind making fun of someone's appearance/behavior, doesn't mind being made fun of, the kind of people that isn't aware of mental health or others' sensitivity to their jokes, sometimes are condescending/patronizing, and kind of *hate* me because they think I'm too sensitive, not ""normies"" in terms of fashion/movie taste or something).","Seeking professional help is a very good idea!

I will also say that I also suffer from a sense of ""what is the point?"" And feeling like even my free time needs to be productive time 24/7.

We talked the whole time, and in the moment I felt fine, but after it all I started getting worried about the future of our friendship.

She has a very strong personality and based on what we were talking about alone, I could see her talking bad about me behind my back if I made one mistake. Because of this, she's not someone I would normally mingle with in the first place; she's more my sister's type. I'm really only friends her because I'm close with my sister and we get along. But I do worry about disagreeing with her because she seems so set in her ways and I feel like I would have to be the one making a compromise (because I always am).

Maybe I'm having flashbacks to being pressured to be a ""yes"" man to my old ""friends"" in middle school and I don't want to be in that kind of one-sided relationship again. Maybe it really is just all in my head and my thoughts are being irrational. Maybe I've just been caught up in this friendship I never would have initiated on my own and having a hard time dealing with it. Maybe I'm just being selfish and trying to take the easy way out. I can't tell.

I was reminded of why I avoid making friends in the first place, which is because I assume everyone will hate me if they got to know me.

27F, been on and off the apps for years. I’ve tried them all, I’m now trying bumble because the guys that have been reaching out to me I wasn’t interested in (luck still sucks). The one time I dated a guy for a few months, I wanted it to end because I feel like I settled due to lack of physical attraction. Now, I’ve been on bumble for a brief while and met up with two guys. The first guy seemed to like me but I didn’t like him. I just met up with another guy, we talked for a few hours and he seemed interested in meeting up again. I enjoyed talking to him I’m just not sure if I would want to take it any further, part of me is kind of interested in going out a second time but I remember how I settled for the last guy I saw for a few months. I ended up seeing the second guy Saturday and was kind of irritated by him, he ended up saying that he wasn’t feeling it from me &amp; thinks it won’t work out. I wouldn’t have gone out again but it’s the fact that he ended things first. I want the romance from dating, just a little note that I don’t really have sexual desire. I like the thought of intimacy like kissing etc but I don’t masturbate and haven’t had sex in years. Could that contribute to my lack of success? Or am I just not meeting the right guys? I feel like dating shouldn’t be this hard, my life is all about shutting down the ones I don’t want &amp; the ones I do want don’t feel the same way.

I came to the point where Ima die alone meaning probably not having a love life partner. I love my family and everything, but I feel something deep inside that is missing and I don’t know what it is. Thanks to my social anxiety it’s stops me from meeting women, talking to them and just making eye contact, I don’t know I’m lost and literally feel like shit, I’ve had girls in my life interested in me but with my social anxiety I’ve lost them. I pray for god to help me cause I’m starting to lose hope.","I have anxiety all day every day about contracting a serious physical illness.

"rm4qas","Unable to hold interactions after hitting puberty","When schools where reopened I lost all my friends them abandoning me for some reason. I've also had to sit alone at lunch which is really embarrassing and I usually would end up crying by myself some of the girls would wave at me - not in a nice way but more in like a mocking way - as if I was a freak. I've lost all my confidence, I hate my face, I hate my body, I hate myself, I hate being so fucking tall 5'8"" because I can't even hide from people as easy others. I'm so ugly and tall and sticklike and I've been to the doctors they say I'm underweight but I feel and get told I am so huge even then. I've been bullied my hole life but now it's just 10x worse because I've got nobody who realistically cares about me anymore. Last week in school I remember I kept hearing ppl talk about me and calling me giant and ugly and a weirdo. I even heard a girls boyfriend say he can't believe she used to be friends with me. 

My home isn't much better as my mam ignores me and my problems my brothers constantly mock me and my dads off with his new family. I just wish my life was like everybody else's I can't cope anymore. This is my throwawayaccount obviously. I don't know why I came to this subreddit or what I am looking for, but if there is even slightest chance I can have friends again then please give this to me.

Everything was right before hitting puberty. I had many friends, I had great time with everyone. But now even my childhood friends refuse to talk to me or have blocked my numbers or straight up ignore if I ever try to strike up a conversation or even call their name. I hate being tall i hate looking like a fucking skeleton. Everything was great before puberty when I wasn't self aware but after 13, I started noticing myself more and noticing my flaws and now I cant talk to anyone. I will probably choke on my own spit if I was out and someone tried to talk to to me or something","First of all, it takes a lot of courage to take the first step, so well done for reaching out and even thinking about learning how to drive.

I'm going to say that the *best* thing you can do is find a driving instructor who fits you. My first instructor was a terrible fit and I almost gave up entirely, but I reached out to a second instuctor and the difference it made was incredible. Finding somebody calm and who you feel at ease with is essential, and that could take time all of its own. But, as far as I can tell the majority of driving instructors are calm/have nerves of steel and are fairly social people.

I will say that I was lucky - I picked a driving instructor that *specialised* in SEN/anxiety, so it was easy for me to be open with him and he eased me in to the whole driving thing. Although you might not be able to find the same, it is *always* worth checking. Even if, say, you choose based on gender, or what they say about themselves.

Secondly, yes, doing the final tests with a stranger is terrifying. I forgot how to start the car and made *a lot* of mistakes my first time. Huge mistakes. It felt awful failing, but the next time I did the test it was a lot easier. But, again, not only was I calmer I also had a far friendlier examiner. We got along well. I passed with very few minors that time, mostly for hesitation.

The first time I went for gas was frightening but by the third or forth time it was just routine. You'll do it a lot and it *does* get easier. You're just one of hundreds of strangers those peope are serving, so chat is always at a minimum anyway - unless you're paying by the pump, then no contact required. And... the likelihood of you having to stop for the police is extremely small. I've had to move out the way of emergency services maybe three or four times in three years of driving.

And please don't worry about time. Yes, driving will open up your world, but you've got to move at your own pace. All you need is an hour or two a week (at least here) to learn, which can easily be fit in around a job or study. Sometimes we need to build up to things. For example, it isn't the same, but I would have been too anxious to learn how to drive if I hadn't done the theory first.

I actually really hate driving but I can say is that it's a self-contained space where you're in control, and that's always a bonus.","https://www.succeedsocially.com"
"rn8iqo","I simply cannot speak to my family at family gatherings.","At family gatherings, we’ll go round to my grandma’s house with aunts, uncles &amp; cousins and eat, listen to music etc. It mainly consists of the adults partying whilst the kids just sit there…

Every gathering it consists of me sitting there on my phone whilst my cousins and my brother speak. I have panic attacks and I can’t eat or sleep anytime there’s an upcoming family gathering bc I’m scared about what they’re all thinking. I’m just known to sit there, quiet, head in phone, only speaking to my brother and sister when I get the chance to. I think a lot of time they think I’m rude bc of this &amp; my household family have brought it up several times.

When we were smaller, I used to speak to them no problem but now I simply can’t speak to my cousins without embarrassing myself and getting flustered. These are the same people I’ve been with at every single family gathering since I was born, it’s not as if they’re extended family or anything.

It could also be due to the fact that I don’t like being in super large spaces with so many people?

Otherwise, anxiety can cause hyper stimulated nerves and your bladder control is at the end of your nerve fibers in your body.

I don‚Äôt know how much this will help you, and it may not exactly be what you want to hear, but this is what I did. (This takes place right before and intermittently during high school btw.) Once I realized what was happening, I sorta became my own mental health coach. (Which is NOT a good idea btw, don‚Äôt do that. It worked short term but now It‚Äôs the root of my feelings of depression and anxiety, just because of how much I let things slide and tell myself that every bad thing that happens to me is my fault and my fault alone, but that‚Äôs a different story.) _x000D__x000D_
   Anyways, I found new hobbies to take up, like marching band. Marching band was a godsend because I didn‚Äôt have to try to make friends. They just kinda showed up and asserted themselves like ‚Äúhey, I‚Äôm here and we‚Äôre friends now.‚ÄùI also got into theatre and musical theatre, which had the same effect. _x000D__x000D_
   Generally, music helped me let go from the feeling of being left behind by my other friends. If they truly appreciated me, they would seek ME out. Because honestly, that‚Äôs how I found out one of them wasn‚Äôt really a friend, and the other was. I just let them come to me, and whoever did obviously loved hanging out with me and cared for my well-being. _x000D__x000D_
   It was unfortunate and devastating to me that the other friend didn‚Äôt. But I realized that if he wasn‚Äôt going to try being a friend after all the years of me trying, then he was the one with a problem and didn‚Äôt deserve to have me as a friend. I still have issues. I‚Äôve never made my own friend. They‚Äôve always made ME the friend. Which I‚Äôm grateful for, but it still hurts to realize that I can‚Äôt do it. _x000D__x000D_
   I‚Äôm also way too forgiving. Honestly you could wrong me in the dirtiest way, and I‚Äôd forgive you not too long after. It‚Äôs not because I don‚Äôt believe in holding grudges or anything, it‚Äôs mostly because I‚Äôve been wronged so many times that I‚Äôm tired of holding grudges. It‚Äôs much easier to forgive, so the grudges stop piling up and I can take a break from it. _x000D__x000D_

I’ve had many thoughts like “What would happen if I killed myself” I think how peoples reactions would be. I think about if they would even care and who would care more, if they would really miss me. I’ve gone through scenarios in my head like I can’t do it anymore and I search for help and I like feeling like people care. Sounds super selfish, I know. But basically I imagine my therapist and parents wanting to help and be worried about me (meaning they care) and I like that feeling, feeling that others care. My parents do care about me like they feed me and give em all I need. They don’t quite understand mental health though… not really their fault though. 

Im NOT going to kill myself. I’m excited and looking forward to date, get married, get a career, and start my own family. No matter how hard it gets I won’t do it because I know it can hurt others and lead them to do dumb things too.


If I were to tell my therapist about these thoughts and feelings would she tell my parents even though I tell her I won’t do it? Is there a chance she’ll still think y life is in danger and tell them? Because in reality I don’t want anyone to know my parents would be mad and think I’m crazy probably. They’ll say stuff like “god have you this life and you need to be thankful” which will only make em feel worse because I know it’s true.

You have a medical condition, there is nothing wrong with taking medication for it and it's not surprising that it would return without the medication that kept it in check.

The stigma around medication harms the people who could benefit the most from meds, and causes people who do perfectly well on their medication to try to stop it for no reason other than ""I shouldn't have to use it"" and lo and behold, their anxiety comes back without the medication and they suffer unnecessarily...because it's a *disorder* and some people need the medication to fix the problem with their brain so they can function.

Whenever random thoughts or emotions distract you from your breath, really feel the emotion with complete neutrality, and for some reason, it helps you detach from your anxiety. In other words, don't be anxious about anxiety. Allow your body to have anxiety, let it run its course, and simply observe it. Then return to your breath and repeat the process. Don't try to force the distractions away: they are part of the process and just as important as the focusing part.  _x000D__x000D_

I feel like I won't be able to look at someone in the eye and told them my biggest issues and traumas. It makes me anxious just thinking about it. It would be so embarrassing and awful. I would feel like I'm humiliating myself in front of them. I know that maybe it doesn't make any sense, but I think that if I'd open up to someone like that, I wouldn't be able to see them again. Just from the embarrassment. Even if they're a therapist. I would still feel pathetic. 

So guys, how do you manage to do it? I think that I would feel awful after every session.","Personally, I'd take the two-pronged method:  keep a note pad/notes app on your phone with you to write down anything you feel you need to remember/discuss/ think on of the appointment throughout the day, set 2 alarms (one for 'get ready to go' and a second for 'leave the house'), then try and distract yourself until it's time._x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
The notes and alarms are your mental comfort blanket- they're structured ways to help you keep track of the minutiae that can become overwhelming with anxiety. The distractions are just that: distractions. They keep you from dwelling on your anxiety. Try to really enjoy your videogame/netflix/puzzle/gardening/whatever since you know if any stray thoughts come to you, you can instantly write them down, and you won't lose track of time due to multiple alarms._x000D__x000D_

"ru59na","Does the mind ever shut up?","Hey everyone,

Recently I realised that I neglect my relationships, and I should become more vulnerable.
So I installed an app that reminds me to take initiative to text/contact them.
It's a start.

Except it also became clear to me why I wouldn't text them. The anxiety and selfhate becomes unbearable at points. The calmness I feel when I go completely detached from social life is so toxic.
My brain doesn't reward me for taking these fake risks at all.

I don't know if I can keep up, for years I've been trying to push myself and I'm scared I've found my limit, and that this limit is not something that I'm proud of.

When I wake up, I'm relaxed for a few minutes, but then it returns. The doubts from yesterday. My brain always finds something to be anxious about and it doesn't seem to distinct between small or big ""problems"".

It's frustrating. I'm a social person. I need social interaction to get out of my head. Yet it brings me so much stress too.

I was wondering if this ever stops for socially anxious people and if some of you have tips for handling this?

(I never got treated for social anxiety, except some simple talking with a psychologist. Who essentially pushed me the same way I'm doing now)","We cannot say whether you're sick, whether you anxiety, and whether you have Covid. I can say that you definitely do not have one of the three requirements to be hospitalized for Covid in my state, so that might put your nerves at ease.

""I don't want to inflict myself on other people"". I'm worried that consistently asking my partner permission to hold him is going to annoy him. I don't want to risk smothering him by being overly affectionate. At the same time I don't want him to feel unloved or deprived because I'm withdrawing in an attempt not to overwhelm him. I can't ask him every five seconds if I'm annoying him by talking too much. It feels impossible to gauge what he needs or wants in every scenario from second to second. 

I always worry my friends or loved ones are just tolerating me or aren't setting boundaries. I hate feeling this way.","When I remember an awkward moment, I usually feel a (varying) degree of shame. I feel ashamed of what stupid thing I did and can't feel compassion towards myself. _x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
What helps me here (most of the time) is to ""sit"" with the negative emotion and not to try to push it or explain it away. What are you feeling in your body while thinking of that situation? Are you clenching your jaw? Are your shoulders feeling stiff? Is it harder to breathe? Are your hands tingling or feeling hot or cold? What kind of bodily sensations do you feel? Focus on your different body parts and try to describe them as accurately as possible. This helps me to take the immense force of that negative feeling and make it something more simple (i.e. the reaction of my body)._x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
Another - easier - technique is breathing slowly. The rule is: Breath out for at least 6 seconds. I count this way: ""1 Mississippi, 2 Mississippi, ..."" as to not rush my counting. Do the slow breathing until your body calmed down and you can naturally fall in the slow breathing rhythm._x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
Both these techniques help to calm down your nervous system, which is in an agitated state. And to focus your attention on something else than these repeating (unhelpful) thoughts. _x000D__x000D_

Neither of us had previously used these emojis in our convos (we did exchange a few ""💞s"" during Christmas holidays, though), and she solely uses stuff like different colored hearts (blue, brown etc) when tagging her male friends in stories.

So far so good, but I should point out how nothing really happened before that text exchange. Tonight's party got really lame after certain people got pointlessly pissed at our group and there were no ""chill"" or decent moments to just sit down and have a nice talk before. We walked to the party together because of a small accident, and that was like, the best part of the whole night, since we really got going. We later created each other's Mii avatar as well, which was kinda cute. Unfortunately, she had to go home earlier than pretty much everyone else because of... overprotective parenting, lmao.

For context: she's a very introvert and inexperienced ""girly girl"", not having had any sort of relationship beforehand. After all, her besties warned me the journey would've been long and exhausting. With that said, she's very charismatic, mentally sharp and self-aware, and I really doubt she hasn't noticed my blatant flirting yet or that she's just playing with my feelings for her.

So, recently I got a new job working at one of the nearby university athletic departments. I read the job description and it was all stuff I had done before. Normal cleaning duties, basic upkeep, etc. In this case clearly being bathrooms, rooms, offices, locker rooms, etc. I didn’t think much of it. I started last week and a lot of what I do is cleaning womens sports locker rooms. I’m a 20(M) for context. I didn’t think much again until my coworker told me that they have had people not care and just undress in front of them, make and female. Also, they said sometimes when I always announce “maintenance” people will simple not answer.

 This made me get lots of really bad anxiety because now I just imagine a girl walking in on me and undressing and then it being my fault, or I walk in on a girl that failed to tell me she was there. There are no cameras or anything obviously, so I just have so much worry I’m going to get blamed for something that I tried to prevent and lose my job and worse stuff happening. 

What should I do? I don’t want to leave the job.

Then moves on to tell me how amazingly everything is going in their own life. They then ask me how things are going for me, making little critical interjections about my career choices and relationship.

First, read / learn about Social Anxiety (SA), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and Exposure Therapy used for SA.  Kati Morton on YouTube is helpful. Kati explains CBT: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=g7B3n9jobus.  Dr. Aziz Gazipura's YouTube channel as well as his book ""..Solution to Social Anxiety"" helped me a great deal. His books explains what SA is, your 'inner critic,' and later how to use CBT &amp; exposure therapy to overcome SA. Check out, the CBT work sheets from Oxford's ""Managing Social Anxiety"": https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/mobile/view/10.1093/med:psych/9780195336696.001.0001/med-9780195336696-appendix-2.

Fourth, you're young. Yes, 18 is young. You can learn new skills, knowledge, interests, hobbies, etc. It's a matter of time &amp; work. What's something you want to learn how to do? Spend 15 - 90 min. a day learning it and in a few years you'll be proficient. Also, I don't want to send you down a deep ""red pill"" hole, but dating should not be anywhere near a top priority in your life. ""Pursue excellence, not women"" to paraphrase Rich Cooper.

Personally, I have worked out my general go-to options that I'll have as a fallback if i cant decide on food. I know this isnt the best as it doesnt really address the anxiety but it gets me through if I'm really struggling.

I live in a country w affordable healthcare and so at certain ages you get free treatment. Because of that, they usually book the standard appointments. I think it’s every year or every other year. You can ofc book if you have current issues.

I have trouble with jaw. Certain movements are restricted. I have chronic pain in the area etc. my dentist has offered a treatment but I want to look at other options. I’m scared to tell him.

Every time I’ve gone, I’ve pumped myself us and promised that I would be brave and speak. Every time he asks for my issues I go mute. I just shrug my shoulders or laugh. Inside I’m just screaming, trying to make myself talk but it never works.
I used to have someone go with me to the dentist but I got a comment from my previous dentist that I (20) was old enough to go to appointments alone. I felt so humiliated.

I’m so scared that my current dentist will think that I’m exaggerating symptoms or that I’m trying to be a fraud and get something that I don’t deserve. That I’m just wasting the country’s money when others need it more.

I don’t know what to do.","I‚Äôd suggest asking her about this in private in a comfortable setting. She might not be willing to admit it or face the truth if she is experiencing anxiety.

Also, when I have taken small risks, the times I’ve had to go back and ask for revisions or something (like with a family photography session recently, or the last time I went to a salon 5 years ago, or a recent hernia surgery where the scar left a huge weird dent in my otherwise-flat stomach) just kill me.

I have always been one. Even though I know it, so it should be easy to fix, you would think, but it is not easy. Often people take advantage of such personalities. Or Sometimes I may take a loss to myself to help someone gain. Feeling approval from others is always very prevalent. As in even if someone is putting me down, I would just stay quiet or even smile as if I didn't hear or understand. Which only makes you look weak and foolish to others.

People with this type of personality are not respected by the world.  They are the people that others might take advantage of, or feel sorry for. Being overly nice does not make people melt for you. What should a person do? it seems so easy, but easier said then actually done. When you have Social Anxiety.

Recently I realized that even though I have been a pushover all my life. Now people seem to treat my kids and wife with the same attitude that they treat me. Probably because they think I wont stand up to them anyway, so they don't think twice. This is very disturbing to me. Realizing that others would treat my family with low respect because that's the expectations ""I"" have set to them.

I'm looking to break out of the Pushover personality. I'm 33 and have been one al my life, so don't know how that's gonna happen. I would never be a jerk or bully. But if only I could stand up for myself.

15M, this is a burner account. In elementary/middle school, I was an outgoing kid and I made a lot of friends in  my school. I felt really comfortable around my peers and actually enjoyed school. Over COVID, my family made the decision to move across the country. When I started my 8th grade year, I was so socially awkward, nothing like I was before. I would hardly say anything in an entire school day, and whenever someone would talk to me my face would get really red and I wouldn’t know what to say. This behavior continued throughout the whole year, I didn’t manage to make a single friend. I never knew what to say when someone tried to talk to me. Going into my high school year, I thought it was going to be different. After all, nobody knew each other so everybody would be trying to make friends. I was wrong. Although I talked a bit more in class, I am still insanely awkward. I think my issue is that it’s really difficult for me to express my thoughts. I can think of something perfectly good in my head, but when I try to convey that thought I sound like a moron. I also get really confused on simple social queues. For example, when somebody waves at me, I try to smile and wave back but I end up looking really stupid and I get really flustered. I also have no clue how to go up to somebody and start a conversation. Eye contact is also really confusing for me, like when I look around the classroom and I try to avoid looking at people but then the deliberate avoidance makes me look like more of a creep.

When at home with family, I’m mostly okay, though I’d obviously prefer to eat alone. I think I’ve just accepted that it’s too hard to get around that. However, during lunch at school, I don’t eat. In elementary and middle school I would either pretend to eat or not eat anything at all, and in high school I just skip lunch entirely and do my homework in the library. I justify it by telling myself I’m being more productive, but the truth is my stomach starts rumbling as the day goes on. It feels like everyone is staring and judging me when I do eat in public, looking at what I eat, the way I eat, the fact that I, the shy kid, am eating, etc, so it’s just too embarrassing. I don’t have an eating disorder or body image issues really, and I’m skinny so it’s not an issue of my weight. Also, even if I did eat, I wouldn’t have any friends to sit with. Does anyone else struggle with this phobia? I know it’s just bad anxiety but what I don’t understand is how I’ve had this for 12+ years.","Haven't dealt with it personally, but I've known quite a few people who have the same thing as you. Sure I notice it's there, but does it matter to me ? No. It's like freckles. People have them, that's that.

I feel like I’ll have no excuses, as childish as that sounds, and no one to help me anymore when I need it. Like I missed all opportunities of being vulnerable. 

I still don’t know how to drive a car, I haven’t opened up a bank account, I haven’t had my first job yet, and sometimes I feel like I can’t communicate with anyone or find any friends. I’m planning on going to college near my home but even that is widely intimidating.

Okay so I really enjoy boxing and up until recently I was in a small class for it.
I went with my sister and I was able to practice with her instead of a complete stranger.
She decided that she would quit until I ‘got my act together’ and ‘stopped being a bitch’.
I don’t see how I could’ve come across like that that, to me, I act completely normal.
Now that she has quit boxing, I can’t go anymore because I would have to fight a stranger.

I still get upset about this because that was one of the things that made me actually happy, what I don’t understand is how she expected us to repair our relationship if she has taken away my source of enjoyment and the only time I leave the house other than school.

It has made me hate her mpre than ever.","It‚Äôs really easy for me to dwell on the past.

Of course, if you could speak to a counselor or therapist, I'm sure it would very much help you cope with these feelings and fears, but until then just here to offer you a little sympathy and support. I have a milder form of this (also lose appetite, feel physically unwell, etc.), It really sucks.  :(_x000D__x000D_
BUT, good news - I've slowly been learning how to deal with it, and so I believe you can too! There's no need to judge or hate yourself for feeling the way you do, not at all. It's the reaction you have when you feel you need to protect yourself from future/possible hurt (for example, that she'll leave or reject you) - it is just a very natural and useful self-preservation mechanism. It might be a little overactive in our cases but I've found that it helps to think about where this fear is coming from (trauma, past abandonment, low self esteem, etc.) and try not to act on that fear but rather consciously practice a habit of trust (I trust her not to hurt me, or leave me; I trust that she means it when she says she loves me; etc.) Slowly, being very gentle and kind to yourself, you can start to address those underlying causes. In the meanwhile though, when you start to have those fears and anxieties, try to notice or recognise them for what they are - reactions to triggers, in order to preserve yourself - before they really start spiralling. Pause at that initial moment, breathe, and practice telling yourself that you are good enough to be loved as you are, you are capable and strong enough to be well even if things go badly, you are worthy of her attention and time and effort, and that it might take some time to build trust in your relationship, but that's alright, give yourselves that time. Also, think of asking for her help as teamwork with your girlfriend, keep doing the communication stuff you wrote about, it is excellent! :) I don't know if any of this helped, but I truly hope you can be comfortable and joyful in your relationship... and wish you the very best! üå∏","https://www.verywellmind.com/work-anxiety-4692762"

I tried sorority recruitment to meet people even though it’s not for me. I thought it could at least be an easier way to make friends, but I got dropped by all of them before I even finished the process.

So now I’m at my lowest of lows and I have no clue what to do. I love a lot of things about my school, but I’m realizing that maybe the people here aren’t for me. I’ve thought about transferring, but my mind is just all over the place.

Idk what advice or recommendations people have, but I’ll take anything. Thanks to whoever started this community, I’m so glad we all have each other :)","My anxiety is very similar.

You don't have to return to the past. Whatever mistakes you make right now, you can always fix them rather than go back in time and changing it. Sometimes, even if you did the right thing, not everything will fall into place.

What helps me is knowing that hilariously, whatever I choose, I'd still be plagued with anxiety anyway. So, if I make mistakes, I fix them or I change how I view them. If I don't, and things still don't fall my way, I know to take different routes in the future.

Know that nothing is set in stone. Sometimes you're here right now so that something else better might happen. 

And i know this sounds superbly optimistic, but it has happened to me several times that I realise following my gut instinct is key. People like us with anxieties, have sharper gut instincts (because we think about everything too much). So if you followed, and things screw up, there must be something else you're missing. If you didn't, and it screwed up, know to follow your gut instinct next time, but always try to either fix the mistake or change your perspective of it. 

It's not easy to do, it takes time, and a lot of therapy. You gotta make it a habit, and it'll slowly feel better over time. There are no shortcuts to feeling better, just time and learning more about yourself :)

The majority of my friends have very active social lives while I am a skittish recluse. This makes me feel extremely self conscious.

Up until now, I have spent nearly all of my life alone or with people who treated me poorly. My self esteem is quite low and I feel chronically uncool and unwanted. Beyond trust issues, I am so afraid that because I have been cast out by certain ex-friends and struggle with mental illnesses, I might have an unflattering reputation. I hide from people because I worry they may have heard of me and hate me. I get extremely defensive in my head when people make me feel afraid, and I put huge walls up. I am becoming a total hermit. I even deleted all my social media.

I am terrified of making new friends because I will either underwhelm them or they will quickly realize I am not very ""cool"" in the rankings and lose interest. Social hierarchies freak me out so I avoid them altogether even though I long to be part of a living and dynamic community. Also, even in like work and housing, people often treat me like a punching bag, a freak and extremely disposable. I feel like I cannot command respect ever. It feels so helpless.

I am so afraid my friends will leave me because they are far more accomplished and established, while I am so far behind and struggling.

It is my starting point to share how I feel and, I think, always felt.

I can recall many incidents from the past where I used to join various social clubs to participate in activities but as the things went better I always turned my back to people I met there and went my own ways. Perhaps it is happening because I often think about my image (social class, hobbies, interests) while being among everyone instead enjoying the flow so it seems a fair reason why I can't fit.

The thing is, I will fall out of my familys insurance when I turn 23 which is this year in autumn. Until then I should work again so I can have an insurance. I'm so desperate I cried today because I'm not even able to call a doctor for this issue.
I know I should let others do the calls for me but it's so embarrassing and at some point I still have to take these calls myself. I wish I could do it by myself but I have not found a strategy yet that would shut my mind up so I can get over this fear. 
I don't know if there even is a good (or any) solution for this problem.","I don't have any great advice, but I can relate. I completely trust my boyfriend but I get really sad for some reason whenever he hangs out with friends (any friends, girls or guys). I feel jealous but I truly don't know why other than that it must be anxiety related. I guess the best you can do for now is just be open and honest with eachother about your feelings. You can explain to her that it hurts when she doesn't trust you and she can maybe try to indicate why exactly it bothers her. You shouldn't have to not hang out with people as that just isn't a healthy solution. The one thing that can help is if I make sure to plan something with my friends or family when I know my boyfriend is hanging out with his so I'm not at home by myself because I know I'm sensitive about it but in complete honesty, as much as my boyfriend is an absolute angel when it comes to helping me with my anxiety, it is something I mainly just have to feel and work through on my own. Sorry I couldn't offer better advice but I hope this helps a little and best of luck to you both!","https://screening.mhanational.org/content/stopping-stupid-thoughts/"
"s7l779","How do you stop talking?","I have two modes:  
1. not talking and freaking out  
2. talking far too much and being annoying  

I’ve been able to deal with 1 through forcing myself to practise but that’s lead me to 2. I know it’s not in my head because people have literally said to me that I talk too much. I’m aware of it while I’m doing it and there’s some disconnect between my brain and my mouth where my brain says “ok you can shut up now” but my mouth keeps going.  

What are your tips to stop talking when you get stuck talking too much?","I have terrible anxiety with grocery shopping. Something that helps me is listening to music while shopping, usually an instrumental playlist. Also making a shopping list ahead of time. If I‚Äôm familiar enough with the store, I‚Äôll list everything by the way I‚Äôd shop through the building. The list keeps me from wandering aimlessly and becoming overwhelmed. Neither things help me get up and go to the store as soon as I need to, but it does make a difference in the shop. I hope this helps you some!","https://www.succeedsocially.com"
