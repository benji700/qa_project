I started making online friends due to covid. I started playing online RPGs (like D&amp;D) to make friends and practice social interactions. All interactions happen pretty much through discord. There's one person I really feel a friendly connection with and like to talk to and message. But he seems like a very reserved person and I'm always initiating contact.
We've messaged for hours yesterday and the day before. So now I feel anxiety about messaging him again because I don't want to seem needy or bother him. I'm just not sure if he's too nice to tell me I bother him or if he likes to talk to me. I also can't ask him that because I feel anxious about that, too.
I don't want to ruin a potential great friendship. So now I'm kind of in this awkward state of checking my discord every 5 minutes...seeing that he's online and closing it again because I'm afraid 😭

If he didn't care about you, then the prospect of you cheating wouldn't bother him. That's certainly how it felt from my perspective. This was the dominant feeling always.

Insecurity, though, is a persistent beast and it chipped away at me. Backing me in to a corner where I felt the need to always make these jokes.

My relationship didn't work out, though it could have. I think one of the things that would have helped would have been really open and frank dialogue. Sitting down and talking bilaterally.

So to keep it kind of brief, I'm a 22 year old male. I spent alot of my teenage years kind of dicking around. I've only recently started reading and finding myself wanting to learn alot more new things. Until I heard that after the age 25 your brain starts to deteriorate/stop growing.

This terrifies me man. I don't wanna be able to not learn. I still wanna be able to understand and grasp new concepts. I'm a law student, and I really want to get into coding, but in like 4 years. I feel like I'm running out of time.

Ik I'm still ""young"" but I just can't take that after age 25, everything becomes significantly harder to grasp. Ugh

 I'm kind of simplifying, because I know it doesn't really ""Deteriorate"".

Mine have ranged from really violent things all the way down to telling people they're fat or yelling in the cinema. I've never acted on them and I don't want to and that's why they feel like they have power. It's the result of you actually acting on them that is scary. And it's more than just a thought it's a feeling that you really want to do it. Like others have mentioned it feels like a compulsion._x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
I haven't really been affected by them in a long time though and whenever they've cropped up it's usually been during higher stress times. Otherwise for the most part I try to make a mental point of finding them funny in a dark humor kind of way. If you think they're funny it really goes a long way to take the power away from the thought. _x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
Making them funny seems like a weird thing to do but I've got a technique that I learned in The Happiness Trap (Book) that worked for me when I didn't understand them and I couldn't deal with them._x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
I'm paraphrasing here but it goes like this: First imagine the situation of your intrusive thought. Picture it happening in your mind and then slowly transfer that image to a black and while television. Now that the thought is on the television mentally place some little cowboy hats on the people in the scene. Let the TV have some bad reception and you have to hit it to clear it up. If there's anything dangerous going on in the scene maybe just replace it with something silly. If there's a knife or something sharp maybe now it's a sausage. Just keep going through the thought and make it ridiculous. _x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
I believe they call it cognitive defusion in the book. It really helped me untangle from the thoughts and stopped them from affecting me. You have to keep practicing and practicing, each time the intrusive thoughts pop up make them silly and eventually it starts really working._x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
I had a suicide intrusive thought as well and I used to turn the word into 3D word art in my head and imagine stupid music and streamers. Worked a treat -- after a while I forgot I even had a problem with it because it just stopped affecting me._x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
Something else that's really useful is just being able to name the thing that is happening. When the thoughts pop up like you want to leave your SO you mentally make a note: ""Ah ha! An intrusive thought!"". In meditation circles they would say that those thoughts are coming from the Monkey Mind and they don't actually belong to you. That can also help you to name them: ""The monkey brain has given me an intrusive thought! It's the leaving my SO one, good joke monkey brain."" Even though it doesn't feel funny to begin with I found after a while it actually did become funny. As morbid and terrible as they seem you can make light of them in your own mind to liberate yourself._x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
Anyway that's a big wall of text but I hope something in there is helpful to you. And remember there's no silver bullets or quick fixes just hard work and practice. Stick at it and your mental health won't dominate you! You can do it!_x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
I thoroughly recommend The Happiness Trap. I would say it saved me from tonnes of turmoil in my life and there's heaaaps of other things that might help you in there._x000D__x000D_

i do get quite a lot of anxiety from knowing my voice is broadcast to the public though, because i can‚Äôt stand my own voice, at least i couldn‚Äôt when i first started making vids. now i‚Äôm kinda used to it, but it still makes me nervous knowing it.

as for streaming, i‚Äôve found it to be a bit easier than making videos, but that‚Äôs mainly because i get like 3 viewers the whole stream and that‚Äôs all. i‚Äôve had times when i‚Äôve gotten like 10 viewers, and thats usually when i start getting extremely nervous. i can handle one or two chatters, but 5 or more people actively talking about what i‚Äôm doing (and my bad game skills) can be pretty stressful. 

i‚Äôve been doing it for 2 years though, so i‚Äôve gotten more used to it over time. that‚Äôs probably the biggest thing honestly. if you keep at it, it‚Äôs likely that eventually you‚Äôll get used to the thought of other people watching your videos.

that‚Äôs mostly all the advice i can give. i‚Äôve had a few loyal followers that have stayed with me for more than a year, and they‚Äôre the real reason i keep uploading and streaming. hopefully you find some people like that who can keep you motivated and give you reassurance! best of luck!"

My anxiety has been building up the past two months and climaxed on Monday. I requested a leave of absence and flew home because I wasn't sleeping or eating anymore and was crying all the time. I want to go back because the job is good and I like my colleagues but I'm afraid.

Since starting my SSRI, occasional diarrhea turned into chronic diarrhea 7-8 times a day, typically the very worst kind on the chart or second worst.

Yes, i can relate. My Wife has Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Also emotionally immature, low self esteem. Poor body image, and insecure.

Why did we get along? Well ive had similar traits. Insecure and jealous. Poor self esteem and self worth, so i never looked at her as damaged like most would. I knew i was just as damaged, so how can i judge her?

Anyways, im addicted to self help now, so after i started feeling better about myself, i noticed a pattern of behavior from our past fights. After she cheated on me a couple of times and had a couple incidents on Facebook where she had inappropriate conversations with guys. Yes i stayed because i got problems of my own. Codependency i think?

My wife too craves validation from men, and loves to hear compliments like she is beautiful, or that she looks younger. But she also craves it from her female friends. If they stop texting her, she wonders if they are mad at her. She texts and phones her friends multiple times a day, and doesn't get why she keeps losing friends. She will tell me she understands, and knows that she overstepped boundaries, then meet a new girl, only to bombared her with constant messages.

She for some reason NEEDS everyone to like her. She hates rejection. Even from someone she just met. I remember one time she comes home from work, and tells me of a guy at work she just met, and added him on Facebook. I was like, ""you JUST met this guy! You don't even know him!""

Im still with her but have been pondering the possibility of leaving. Ive never understand the need to be validated and accepted as much as my wife needs it. Im also very introverted, so i don't have any friends, and keep to myself. I know my wife has anxiety and that makes her worry and ruminate about everything and everyone but its getting to be too much for me. I want a quiet, peaceful, simple life.

To your partner I suspect this is the exact opposite of a problem.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Am I doing myself a disservice by taking a hard stance against medicines, even though I've made progress without? Should I be working with a psychologist or phychiatrist? I'm living alone in a foreign country and it can be difficult to find suitable English speaking help but desperately want to resume ""normal life"". 

Well, lets talk about meds first.  I am not a fan of using typical mental health meds unless it's necessary.  They have side effects that can be problematic and we aren't even sure exactly how they work.  In a case where someone is totally hosed up or suicidal, yeah, no brainer put them on something to stabilize them and work on getting other treatments involved so they can ween off.  Most of us fall short of that so it becomes a personal choice on how badly it is affecting your life.  

Now when it comes to other professional help, such as a therapist, they can be a GREAT tool and there is no good reason not to use one as a mean to improve your life.  You can also do the therapy 100% online so you don't need to limit yourself to folks in your immediate area which should help with the language issue.  I've had probably 6 therapist until I found my last one which I have used for two years.  Not all therapist are made equal and not all are a good fit even if they are good at their jobs but when you find one that matches well they can really help."

You can explain to her that it hurts when she doesn't trust you and she can maybe try to indicate why exactly it bothers her. You shouldn't have to not hang out with people as that just isn't a healthy solution.

He did not give me any time be okay with this, in fact I didn’t even know what he was prescribing me until he was on the phone with my pharmacy. 

Upon further research, I really don’t feel comfortable taking an antipsychotic off label for anxiety as my first medication trial. I also spoke to my grandmother about it (my primary parent growing up) and apparently my mother was put on Seroquel for her schizophrenia and did not have a good reaction to it at all because of a heart condition I also have. I mentioned this to my doctor and he said I should be fine because they will give me EKGs, however I am still just not comfortable. 

While talking to my grandmother about this, she mentioned that she was prescribed Zoloft to quit smoking, but it made a significant difference in her experience with anxiety and PTSD. I did a little more research and I’m seeing that Zoloft is not only one of the few medications approved to treat social anxiety, but it also is one of the easiest on the heart! 

I’m a bit nervous about talking to my doctor about making this switch, as I don’t want to offend him, he isn’t the greatest listener, and I find him quite intimidating (unfortunately I am stuck with him until I leave this program).

If you are a caffeine user, either quit or cut down, for me this had the biggest effect on reducing these issues. Likewise, try to cut sugar down, stay away from alcohol &amp; drugs, even pot, &amp; just eat healthy in general, make sure to sleep well &amp; to be active (not necessarily exercise, just going for a half hour walk around your neighborhood will work). After that, I find it helpful to connect with the natural world &amp; engage the senses, this helps get you out of your head &amp; into your body. For example, go for a walk in nature &amp; smell the air, feel the plants or ground, pet an animal, that sort of thing. These are all the starting point things I would recommend. If you are still really suffering, I would recommend reaching out to a mental health professional, or even the counselor at your school if they are good. I've personally had a hard time finding a therapist I connected with, but I found the book 'How to stop worrying &amp; start living' by Dale Carnegie very helpful. It sounds cheesy, but it's pretty practical advice imo.

I always worry about my heart even though I’m told I’m fine. I always check it when I walk around and get up from sitting etc. My resting can go down to the low 60s when it’s time for bed. When I sit it’s around 80s. 

I have been having so many symptoms since then and I still do. 

-skipped beat feelings every day(It happens randomly! I can have it during exercise, after exercise, when I eat, when at rest)

-high heart rate when I just get up from sitting walk around it’s in the 110s

-sensitive skin when I take my clothes off hard or rub my skin it’s just noticeable but not painful

-random quick head pains sometimes either side 

-tight upper back always cracks

-costcondritis left side tender always under left breast

I have this habit as well - sometimes it can really get in the way, especially if I sense somebody genuinely dislikes me and I know it's not me overthinking. In these moments I learn the most - I realize how silly it is to worry about what other will think, there will always be people who will agree and disagree. There will be those who don't like you just cause. And there will be those who will accept you just cause and won't be bothered by your flaws and quirks, even if you think they are a big deal. Every situation is a different mixture of these types of people, and trying to appeal to all will end up hampering your approach to achieving your goals. Some decisions are unpopular for a reason. Nevertheless, don't let your thoughts control you, be as true to yourself as possible, even when that means winning a few enemies.

I think he is having some IBS stuff.

Although work was/is a triggering event for his newly diagnosed anxiety, he doesn't feel that is what is keeping it going. In the past few years his dad got diagnosed with cancer, we had a child, he lost his job due to covid (out of control) to go to a temp. job for a year because of covid, now to having a good job again but now he is having anxiety which has prevented him from going to work some days lately.

Having anxiety myself i know things are easier said then done. Im wanting him to push foward instead of using PTO/sick time because i feel he has used A LOT of it already and its only FEB. Im starting to get really worried for him... and his job.

They havent said anything to him but i can imagine if this keeps going on something will be said. Hes explained things to his manager and his manager also has some anxiety issues so says he understands but also if this continues theres only so much the manager can help. 

He is on 10mg of lexapro since this started in JAN. and has made an apt for therapy through his works EAP but we are still waiting to get contacted by someone. He said his mind no longer races and heart no loner beats fast like it use to in the AM when he would wake up but still having the stomach stuff.

I says he doesnt feel depressed and from the outside looking in he doesn't seemed to be depressed. Seems like mostly anxiety triggered by all these past stressful events. Hes seen his doc and blood work has come back normal.

Having to come to terms with life in the sense of, your born, you live, you die. Sounds quite abrupt and final but that‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been feeling. I thought I had accepted and come to terms with it but evidently I haven‚Äôt. I‚Äôve also been questioning the point in life, why and how it is meaningful; I always seem to find a reason as to why it isn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not suicidal, nor do I have ‚Äòbad‚Äô thoughts. I want to live, and have a happy life. I think these thoughts are normal, or normal to question and ponder at some point in your life. When we have anxiety however it is how much we dwell and revisit these thoughts, allowing them to take over our lives. I was on antidepressants for the majority of my life and I feel as if I was numbed to any feelings of ‚Äònormal life anxieties.‚Äô Like I expect everyone goes through it and now I‚Äôm off meds I‚Äôm being hit majorly by every emotion and feeling I missed out on, you know? Unfortunately I haven‚Äôt had similar feelings of life not being real, so I can‚Äôt share any ‚Äòremedies‚Äô or great words of comfort. I do know a lot of people do feel this way though, or experience it at least once in their life. I have experienced the whole out of body experience and feeling of detachment from oneself through anxiety however. It‚Äôs horrible and quite unsettling; you do question if you‚Äôre losing it. 
I think when we have these thoughts, perpetuating our anxiety, whatever they may be, we struggle with the horror of having to accept them as a reality, as we have realised a truth. And I think that scares us, we don‚Äôt know what to do with that information, it provides us no comfort, and we believe we‚Äôve ‚Äòjust gotta live with it.‚Äô I suppose we do, it‚Äôs how we handle the the truth and process it that seems to ‚Äòmake or break‚Äô us. How we choose to interpret it. REBT methods can be quite good for rationalising these thoughts, but they‚Äôre not helpful for everyone. I‚Äôm being pushed to take meds again, by family, but I don‚Äôt want them, I don‚Äôt want to be numb again.

Sleep is obviously needed for us humans to function properly. When you're tired, it's the body's way of telling you it needs to get some rest. It's not meant to make you frightened or scared of sleeping. Believe it or not, staying awake more means that people like us tend to overthink more and come up with worst case scenario disasters in our heads. 

So obviously meditation doesn't work for you. Have you looked into other sleep-inducing remidies like ASMR? I like to watch it before I sleep to help me feel more sleepy otherwise I'll lay there awake for hours. Or maybe listen to white noise? (rain, trees, waterfalls etc.) 

I hope that helps, remember that sleep is the body's way to rest both your body and your head which includes all of your mental thoughts and feelings. You may find that getting a good night's sleep may reduce your fear of sleeping the next night."

I had too much stress and anxiety to be able to add words to it at that stage. I'm now an EFT Practitioner, and I use it everyday for emotional self-care and health because of how beneficial it is for my well-being. 

Regarding your second question, the way we target different anxiety issues with EFT is to use precise and targeted words that best describe our experience of anxiety about a certain situation, not by tapping on any any particular point. Anxiety is often linked to worry and over-thinking, and it can also have physical manifestations (headaches, migraines, stomachs aches, neck pain etc). So you want to try and find the precise words to label your experience; that is what will be most beneficial for experiencing relief and shifts in your anxiety levels. 

For me personally, it wasn't until I did a tapping course for my own anxiety and stress levels 7 years ago that I actually understood how to tap in a way that was most beneficial, with words and all. That's when I learned about the importance of keeping track of the progress I was making by noting down  my anxiety numbers 0-10 for all the different issues I wanted to work on.  

I recommend keeping track of your progress in a tapping journal or in a file on your computer, so that you can see whether you are making progress.

If anything is different, it may be the fact that you can work as a entrepreneur or pursue your passion and you dont need nobody's validation. Remember many successful actors, singers, business owners etc..some of them, they didn't have their plan figured out until very late age. With every new day there is new oportunity, new experience...new thoughts to be thought about. Dont be so hard on yourself and give yourself some time. There is  need for you to have all figured out at certain age. Accept it as some form of experience. You just found out what you dont want to do. So every experience like this just put you closer to the stuff you actually want to do. You just have to try things and give yourself some time to think, relax and possibly refocus üòá Hold on, my man. And if you ever feel low, hit me up üòá"

(Keep in mind, I have NEVER used illicit substances, and have no history of alcohol abuse)

For some context, I’m diagnosed with all anxiety disorders, and MDD.
I’m on a high dose of Zoloft to combat this, but due to the response only being partial, psychiatrist has added 100mg Seroquel (IR) at night which he claims is to augment the anti-anxiety effect of Zoloft. 
This causes me to doubt what his logic is. He is clearly avoiding minor-tranquillisers as my PRN, and on top of the 100mg Seroquel, he wants me to take 25mg as needed during the day when the anxiety demands it. 

The potential side effect profile of anti-psychotic medication is on par and arguably worse than benzodiazepines, and the current Seroquel dosage is a total joke to claim ‘Anti-anxiety’. He tries pushing his idea that it ‘increases’ Dopamine.

I wasn’t born yesterday, and I do my research. At this dose, all it’d be doing is acting as an antihistamine, and maybe an ever so slight balancing of SERT and DAT. Granted, the antihistamine effect can help a bit with being nervousness and agitated, but it’s offensive being told to take it for my chronic and crippling panic disorder. All it will do is cause strong sedation. My psychiatrist has over 15 years of experience and is a consultant psych, and this fact makes his prescribing behaviour even more unusual.","Psychiatrist Prescribing Questionable Medication (PLEASE HELP!!)","Advice Needed","hvp7jmh","winterstl","/r/Anxiety/comments/sl7tyy/psychiatrist_prescribing_questionable_medication/hvp7jmh/",1,1644070811,"Doctors avoid prescribing benzos due to risks of addiction","t3_sl7tyy","t3_sl7tyy","anxiety","reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/sl7tyy/psychiatrist_prescribing_questionable_medication/","https://screening.mhanational.org/content/how-do-you-treat-anxiety/","Hello.

Second, I think you need to ask your self why having your plans cancelled triggers you. Your reactions do seem like trigger responses. In my opinion the cancellations hurt you because you see them as a rejection instead of circumstance. The pain is self inflicted because of your perceptions of the event, not the actual event itself. If you can accept that a cancellation is not a rejection then you will feel less pain when it happens. Additionally I would encourage you to make a list of all the times you were 'cancelled' to find the precipitating trauma that caused you to respond the way you do now to having plans change. Keep in mind a trauma does not have to be a profound event, it is an event that hurt YOU deeply enough to leave a trigger behind.

Take a shower, towards the end make the water as cold as you can take and let it run on your face / head for 10 seconds.

Try to watch a show or movie that you feel comfortable with, preferably something you‚Äôve already seen that brings you comfort.

If worst comes to worst and you feel a panic attack coming on again, take a Benadryl if you have access to it. It‚Äôs an antihistamine and will calm you down and make you tired / put you to sleep. You can get it OTC at any local pharmacy.



Now for the future - begin journaling, try to figure out what your triggers are. See a therapist if you can afford it, this will be the biggest ROI in terms of mental health.

If you trust yourself, go to a doctor and ask for a benzo, as long as you don‚Äôt abuse them you have no risk of addiction.

Was on edge but sleeping ok over Christmas but had developed a sinus infection and my eyes were constantly tired, then in mid Jan I developed tinnitus in my left ear, common for sinus problems. but I noticed that when I got panicked it would get so much louder.

When my anxiety was at the worst and I was feeling all types of scary physical at symptoms I use to believe that they were something underlying or that I had something far more serious when in reality it wasn‚Äôt the case but even after I got over my health anxiety I still had that fear of death and I mean of course everyone fears death but we all fear it differently.

Of course I‚Äôm not saying go hurt yourself or anything or put yourself in harms way and of course I wouldn‚Äôt risk my life or do anything stupid but don‚Äôt fear something that may never come.

Like, every worry he had just went away because well, he was dealing with something else but it changed me perspective on death a bit because I never really thought about how kind of oddly satisfying it would be to say ‚Äúthis is it‚Äù.

I suggest always having some type of protein w you, like beef jerky or a protein bar in your bag/car. The key to preventing blood sugar drops and the following jitters/anxiety isn’t to eat a LOT, it’s to eat foods that will sustain you and not cause a big crash.
Eating more often, but less food when you eat is also good. Like 5 mini-meals throughout the day instead of a few big ones. Maybe set a timer on your phone every two hours to have a snack or mini-meal, and maybe every hour to have half a glass of water? 
I’m sure your panic attack was from being jittery from lack of food, but I think the ones after we’re because you’re scared of panicking again, so you kind of conditioned yourself that pan licking can be prevented by eating.

I‚Äôve had experiences with both of these things myself._x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
One thing I‚Äôd really recommend you listening to is Marisa Peer‚Äôs ‚ÄòI Am Enough‚Äô meditation on YouTube. It‚Äôs a meditation that helps to raise self esteem. I‚Äôve been listening to it for a while now and it is comforting. It is true that with repetition your mind will absorb the affirmations you tell it. Sometimes they‚Äôll feel false or weird to say at first, but stick with them. With time the belief will become second nature. _x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
One piece of advice I‚Äôd like to give you is to try and stop skipping class. I‚Äôve just finished school myself, and when my anxiety reached an all-time high at the end of last year/beginning of this year, all I wanted to do was avoid it. This was because I‚Äôd had a panic attack in class, which resulted in my mind subconsciously viewing school as a threat. I learned in therapy that although avoidance does decrease anxiety in the short term because the ‚Äòthreat‚Äô is no longer present, it actually increases it in the long term because by avoiding class, you‚Äôre basically reinforcing this idea that ‚Äòclass is a threat‚Äô in your mind. I know the anxiety can be so overwhelming, it took a lot of persistence for me to be able to go to my classes again and feel relaxed. But I did do it. Right before lockdown I was the happiest I‚Äôd been in ages. _x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
Lastly, I really recommend reading the book ‚ÄòOvercoming Social Anxiety‚Äô by Tobias Atkins. He gives some really good advice on how to deal with this anxiety as he‚Äôs been through it himself. This book really made me feel less alone._x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
Hang in there, I know how you feel and it can be really tough. But this is not a life sentence. If it‚Äôs available to you, I would recommend seeing a therapist as they can give you advice specific to the things you‚Äôre going through. Sending love your way."

I'm a senior in college and it's gonna take me awhile to finish my degree. Ever since the end of last month, I've been getting mentally crushed by bad thoughts about the world right now. COVID-19, The stuff going on the Russia and Ukraine, the stuff going on about the Winter Olympics, I heard some screwed up stuff about some truckers recently, meteorite detections, etc. On top of that, a lot of my friends are going through hard times or having their lives change suddenly and I'm just sitting through it all, not really able to do a whole lot about it. I've been anxious to all hell about these things and my own health, to the point where I'm physically drained from everything.

I am a 22 y/o (m). And I likely have depression, though I haven't got a diagnosis yet. I have social anxiety too. Most of my peers in my age already have at least a year of job experience (at least part time) under their belt (just want to point out that highschool finishes a year later in my country and working before graduation isn't as common here as it is in the western world, but 1 year of part time work has become normal because most state universities don't take in students for about 1.5 years after they leave highschool). Most are also doing professional courses in parallel to the college studies. Some ditched state university for private campuses that started much earlier and are already doing their final year or interning.    
    
I am different to most of them in the sense that I wasted that 1.5 years after high school trying to sit for my a/l hoping for a better result, only to get disappointed and  applying with my 1st attempt's result in the end, and in the last 2 years I have pretty much done nothing worthwhile. While most batchmates did extra courses, did side gigs, invested in businesses, networked and beefed up their resume, I struggled to do the only coursework I attempted, and am likely to have to repeat an year because I did terribly in recent semester exams.   
   
I feel similar to how you described, like everyone is running a race and I am barely managing to crawl. Everytime I see someone announce a graduation, buying an own vehicle, heck, someone a year older than me is getting married! Meanwhile I don't even have a linkedin profile because there's is nothing to put there except my a/levels.

I have struggled with these kind of questions forever. It's like I am magically handicapped in some way. Everyone has an ambition, goals, are able to make connections and actually work towards their passion. Why can't I be like them? I know spending the whole day on reddit and youtube isn't healthy, and have constantly made attempts to become more outgoing, and active. But I am always the one to not get the memo on things, always the one not to have seen an opportunity and grabbed it. It's like I am always missing out on things.

Reading your post, this is basically me. I‚Äôm currently 22 and feeling very distanced and aloof. I barely had any friends in elementary school/middle school (I was a bit strange/ASD/didn‚Äôt really ‚Äúget‚Äù how to be friends with people) and then in highschool I completely changed myself and my personality to fit in (what‚Äôs also called masking). I acted really dumb, cares only about my appearance and looking hot/being popular, all because I just wanted fo be accepted and have friends. It kinda worked but it also led me to a lot of toxic/abusive relationships and friendships. Finally by the end of highschool I had fixed everything myself and had a solid group of friends I actually liked and trusted, and I went to university and a had great first year making more friends ect. Things started to fall apart in second year tho (when I was 20) as my friendship with my closest best friend broke apart for a variety of reasons, i was in (another) shitty toxic relationship, and things just went down hill. Then i moved abroad to a whole new continent for university and again, I struggled so much with caring by that point about connecting with people and making friends, largely due to the trauma of how things had fallen apart in second year and also because I just started realizing I don‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù anyone, I like being alone and doing my own thing. I guess I am and always have been an aloof and introverted person, I just sometimes ‚Äúpretended‚Äù not to be for validation/ego ect. Anyways, now I am in my fourth year of uni and have a new partner who is very kind, but who struggles to understand where I‚Äôm at with all this. I still have 2-3 REALLY good friends back in my home country who I talk to often, but other than that I have nothing but weak connections/friendships with a few people here, and bc of COVID most didn‚Äôt even return to my city ... so pretty much alone lol. My partner is the complete opposite, he‚Äôs the life of the party, the center of attention and has made so many close friends and connections this year. I‚Äôm really proud of him and I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs having the time of his life but I‚Äôm also just struggling with finding my place in all of this, having no real friends or social life here of my own. Again, maybe I‚Äôm just a distanced and aloof person, because I‚Äôm sure if I wanted to I could try harder to make friends. My partner always brings me to all the parties and he introduces me and encourages me to make friends with all the people there, but I just don‚Äôt have it in me rn. No one really clicks and even if they did, I don‚Äôt know if I have the emotional energy to connect with friends and do things like that. Again, I do really enjoy spending my free time (when i‚Äôm not with my partner or doing school work) chilling by myself, getting high watching shows or writing or reading or whatever,  but then i feel so weird for this being my life. And maybe sometimes I am lonely, if only because my partner always has so many things going on, like he‚Äôs in tons of group chats and societies and has people always messaging him, and then there‚Äôs me LOL. 

Sorry I realize this post is about your issues, didn‚Äôt mean to rant so long. Just thought I‚Äôd let u know that there is someone out there with similar feelings about everything. I can‚Äôt really give u advice because I don‚Äôt know how to ‚Äúremove the barrier‚Äù myself yet, in fact in the last year I‚Äôve probably done the opposite-I don‚Äôt really use my personal social media anymore, I don‚Äôt reach out to many people, I‚Äôve lost a few of my friends back home due to drama/drifting apart, and at parties I mostly stand there and smile as my partner takes center stage-it reminds me of my good old days back in first year uni but it‚Äôs just not for me anymore. Like you, I‚Äôm also just a good-grades producing robot most of the time now, and I think I‚Äôm actually okay with that. I keep telling myself eventually things will change (like post-COVID) and I am looking forward to going back to my home country to see my friends, which will help. But yea, it sounds like you already made some progress by having a healthy relationship with ur bf and u made a strong friendship with someone who seems really interested in getting to know you.

This may have been asked before  but I can't phrase it in a way where I can find the answer I'm looking for. Like the title says, what I mean is if you feel anxious about x thing, say having forgotten your keys (multiple times a day even though you clearly remeber they are there) is it better to check and be like ""see they are there"" or is it worse as in like establishing a pattern where you only feel OK if you check ? The keys is just a simple example of a behaviour I have on many things big and small and I'm wondering if it helps more to ""give in"" and check or to fight off the urge. I spent the last day and half compulsively checking the stipend for a job I was offered in fear it wasn't what I understood, but no amount of checking (like with the keys) helps, so I had to email and ask, as so to have it written out in front of me to be more sure. I am still not 100% ""sure"", I have a meeting on Monday when that's going to be confirmed and until then I won't feel relaxed about it even though I already know that's it. I'm waiting for the ""eff you"" moment where something goes sideways. Anything I can do? Checking and or rationalising doesn't help in these cases.

The general thinking is that no, checking will increase and not decrease the desire to check in the future…. But it sounds like you’re figuring that out on your own. 

The kind of CBT I do would tell you that you don’t have to “fight off” the unpleasant feeling that makes you want to check on something. It’s ok to have that feeling. You can complain about it, write a song about it, feel it as deeply as you can. You don’t have to do anything to get rid of it, and in fact the things you’ve been using to get rid of it are making it worse and not better.

I think everyone has some external things that make them feel more anxiety.

1. Is the term of overidentification. This is when one's sense of self is overcome with emotions, typically negative emotions, and you can't step outside of these yourself. The emotion becomes your identification and you think this is who you are. This happens to me sometimes. One thing that helps me is to think about mindfulness. You can recognize the emotion, you can feel it, you can see it. Now recognize that its there, try to hold it in your mind and manipulate it a bit. You control the emotion now, it doesnt control you. Tell yourself this emotion doesnt control you anymore, you see it its not making you feel better so you are going to cast it aside now. It had its turn.
2. It sounds like you are ruminating on something. You keep coming back to the same thing or feeling and cant get past this. Its cyclical.

As a boy, I used to love sleeping in while on summer break from school. The morning structure of mom waking me, or my alarm waking me, for school in the morning was now (finally) gone. It felt like amazing Zen to experience free, comfortable, cozy, and unencumbered sleep -- and waking up at-will or when my [something] gave me permission, or said ""it's time to move"", to leave my peaceful slumber. 

I saw nothing wrong with it. 

But my dad, who worked in town, had a routine of coming home for his lunch, every single day. His time was usually 1100, but sometimes it was 1045. And often, there may be a reason to swing in earlier for random occasions... And therein lay what became to be a problem. 

He was a good guy, with good intentions, but was none-too-pleased to find any of us still sleeping. We would often hear ""you kids ain't going to be sleeping all day"" or something about ""sleeping till noon"". 

Well, I'd say that's a cause of why I have no problem doing exactly as you, with later bedtimes (and still sleeping 8hr), or those exceptionally late nights being in flow and working on a project, only to feel guilty about getting those 8hrs, because my wake time would be somewhere around 1030-1100.. and, well, I'd be missing out on the World, wouldn't I? Being found to be sleeping, even under basic circumstances like this, brings me anxiety, and so I fritter away at other things to distract myself from the fact that I 'should' be sleeping. Or, I compromise and force myself to be active and awake even if it only gives me 6hrs. 

Sleep is personal, and I wish we didn't feel guilty for getting enough, or choosing to get a responsible amount at odd times of the day -- ie, short or long naps. 

We need to have autonomy and control of our decisions, and accountability for all of our responsibilities, no matter how relevant and unique to you, and your methods or daily process."

Possible Trigger Warning? I’m not sure if this is an accurate representation of anxiety. To preface I recently got promoted and I messed up big time at work when dealing with a coworker acting out. All the other guys in my section saw firsthand how I failed to handle the situation.

After the event, I immediately talked to my mentor on how I could’ve handled the situation better and what to do going forward. This helped with the stress to some degree. Looking back it probably isn’t as big a deal as I’m making it out to be but I was stressing hardcore over the whole ordeal.

I tried the normal methods of dealing with the stress I’m used to by going to the gym and smoking but surprisingly these methods just heightened the anxiety. I think at this point I panicked because my go to routine was failing and was instead increasing my anxiety. I was struggling to breathe normally and I immediately called my family and close friends which definitely helped. My breathing got better but it was still irregular.

- Muscle tension, weakness, aches and pains, cramps, muscle twitches, jaw clenching
- Chest pain or racing heart, heart palpitations, pounding heart, audible heartbeat
- Hair loss, particularly on the crown of the head (telogen effluvium)
- Body-focused repetitive behaviors - skin/scab picking, lip/nail/cheek biting, hair pulling, bouncing of legs or wringing hands, tapping fingers, fidgeting, etc.
- Fatigue, exhaustion, irritability, difficulty focusing, forgetfulness or trouble with memory, insomnia, nightmares or trouble sleeping, frequent sleep disturbances
- Headaches, dizziness, weakness, light-headedness, sweating or shaking
- High blood pressure
- Rashes or [hives](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/why-am-i-breaking-out-in-hives-when-im-stressed/)
- Rapid breathing or shortness of breath
- Hot flashes or chills, feeling overheated or very cold
- Nausea, vomiting, gas, bloating, [acid reflux,](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/acid-reflux-and-anxiety) stomach or digestive problems including diarrhea and constipation, lack of appetite or increased appetite
- Weak immune system, often getting colds for example

Muscle tension is one of the main hallmarks of generalized anxiety disorder - one of the six symptoms required for diagnosis, actually. It manifests in painless twitches or spasms, cramps and soreness. When you are on edge and anxious, your muscles are also tense and prolonged tension leads to pain from the strain on your muscles - just like how working out leads to soreness. I have GAD but also lifelong cerebral palsy which means tense, painful muscles are my default setting.¬† These things may help when it becomes painful:

- CBD oil or cream

- icy/hot patches

- cream with lidocaine

- ginger-based muscle rub

- hot bath with epsom salts or mustard powder

- gentle, frequent stretches; stop when it hurts, repeat every few minutes

- magnesium, potassium and Vitamin D3 supplementation

Don't rule out a problem with your pillow or mattress exacerbating the problem, too, if it's painful for long periods."

At first I didn't even realize it was my anxiety making me like this, but today I was just wondering why I was being so lazy and doing absolutely everything in my power to avoid leaving the house. For the past week I have avoided running into my flatmates, attending my lectures in person, going grocery shopping (because I ran out of almost all my food and have been living off of microwaveable popcorn), and so on. There are so many other things I need to be doing like studying and cleaning my room but my mind is so scrambled right now and I'm so exhausted that I just never get anything done. 

My other issue is sleep. I have essentially become nocturnal because my body is either too worked up because of my anxiety to let me sleep during nighttime or I actively avoid sleeping because I get horrible nightmares/sleep paralysis/hallucinations (I have narcolepsy). This causes me to only fall asleep when I'm at the actual point of exhaustion. It also sucks because I get super paranoid at night. My anxiety actually gets worse because I have this irrational fear that somebody is watching/stalking or that something terrible is going to happen to me.

I'm starting to be super restless and weirdly sometimes hyperactive, but not in a productive way. More like in a I can't control my body type of way. 

Please if anyone has advice on what steps I can take to managing my anxiety (i beg you please do not suggest meditation or yoga) and how to sleep despite anxiety that would be incredible. Also side note, I know people are probably gonna suggest seeing a therapist and/or psychiatrist about my condition, which I am planning on doing, but for now I just need some advice on how to get a little better because there is no way I could talk to someone with how severe my social anxiety is right now.

Most recently, I was on Buspar/Buspirone for a 6-8 month stint in 2020-2021 when my SO of 4 years’ father was nearing end of life and passed away. My GP helped me find Buspar (I had taken Citalopram before and hated the side effects) and she and I worked on dosage on a month-to-month basis. 

After my SO’s father’s passing, a lot of my anxiety went away and my GP and I agreed that I could wean off and stop Buspar. She advised that my anxiety as of late appears to be “situational anxiety” (certain scenarios make my GAD much worse or accelerates symptoms) and recommended I keep my remaining Buspar on hand instead of tossing it. 

The past 3 weeks, I have been experiencing severe anxiety symptoms to the point where I took a day off work because I could not stop shaking or crying (I have rarely taken time off work for anxiety).

It shouldn't be that way. Simple procedures for access to psychological support will save lives.

The narrative of 'omg I have to figure it all out by 25/30 and if I don't I'm doomed' is a throwback to a lifescript/culture that no longer exists, is not reflective of real life and is part of an ageist culture.

We're not rushing to get married off and raise kids in our early 20s like our grandparents/parents/etc. The sort of job market and society that allowed them to buy a house, work the same well-paying job right out of college/highschool and all that no longer exists.

When you see someone who ""has it all"" or achieves great success or fame at 22 or 25 or whatever you need to remember that they are the exception.

Most folks start hitting their stride and feeling okay in their skin/picking up steam way after that point.

I'm also gonna let you in on a secret that I'm only juuust figuring out (I'll be 30 in less than a month after 5 years crying and panicking over it): nobody ever really 'grows up' and 'matures'. You learn how to pay bills, feed yourself or whatever but thinking that you have to suddenly 'become mature' is just a lie. I'm beginning to realize that my grandparents and my parents and aunts/uncles/older cousins are still who they were decades ago. Just different on the outside and (hopefully) having learned things due to all they've experienced.

You've got like...what, another 50-60+ potential years on the planet? Try and remember that you're, in the grand scheme of things, not even quite done growing brain development-wise.

I'm 30 and I'm realizing now that I'm just graduating to baby adult.

Even if you lose weight and start wearing them again, it‚Äôll preserve their longevity if you‚Äôre not wearing them now. You‚Äôre likely gonna save money in the long run.

Also, remember the whole ‚Äúput on your own safety mask before helping others with theirs‚Äù concept. You in a well-fit pair of pants can go out and donate your old ones to people who need them, volunteer your time, or do any other number of things to help your community. And you‚Äôll do it best in pants that fit. :)"

Seems to be a combination of things I've been concerned about in the back of my head, sometimes it's just plain fear of dying or something. It's not new, but since somewhere halfway through 2020 I also started awakening several times a night. Recently I had a good night where this didn't happen but I'm figuring out how to make that normal. Additionally, it seems to cause a constant urge to go to the toilet, some nights I can go up to six or seven times to urinate because the feeling won't go away. Double uncomfortable. 

Some days towards nighttime I also just start feeling too good and energetic which causes me to want to make this opportunity useful to be productive and work on things such as projects. This is another part of the cycle that makes me think it might not only be the anxiety at night, if anyone has any ideas here or has experienced something similar then I'd like to hear it.

My situation is that I’m in a new area and have become quite anxious about going outside, since it gets dark quickly. It’s normal to be cautious when going out alone at night, but when “night” is 6pm and the anxiety is debilitating that’s a problem. Another example is being fearful of a house fire. That’s a normal thing to be mindful of, but when it causes me to check the stove over and over and worry about it while I’m outside, it negatively impacts my life. These are some clear examples, but things can get fuzzy in any area and be less obvious.

One thing to try is thinking ""is this worry productive?"" As in, is there anything you can do about it at this time? If the answer is no, then you may be worrying unnecessarily.

In terms of handling it from there, you can try breathing exercises, distraction techniques, cbt, or other tips suggested by a therapist or in this sub for example.

Yeah, you made a mistake. Maybe you were just not thinking or whatever. But who cares? It's a silly, little mistake. It's so pointless that most people would've just said ""just bring it into the house"" and moved along. It's your *dad's* issue that he decided to react like this to you. It's not your problem that he got this mad over groceries. It's his, and you can't internalize his immature reaction to the situation as some sort of statement on yourself. After all, if he can't tell you how to do things in a helpful way (as you should with your children) then why does he expect you to somehow know things by instinct?

Idk what your dad is like, but if he's anything like mine then it probably won't be any use to confront him about how he talks to you, because he probably thinks he's right to call you names, and that he's doing you a favor. It might be a habit of his to treat you badly when hes upset. You just gotta keep thinking, ""not my problem!"" and remember that there are mature ways to handle things, and then your dad's way. Your dad's way is not the right way. It's immature and unproductive. _x000D__x000D_

It's hard but you gotta just do your best and only take to heart your own evaluations of your performance.

But you can ignore his comments and think ""well this time i brought it up on my own, so thats progress and Im learning. I got it eventually, so that means Im not as dumb like he says. I cant control his emotions or his reactions, and its not my fault if he treats me that badly over a little mistake""_x000D__x000D_

If I remember correctly one of them was done like this:_x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
------------_x000D__x000D_
Take your time to tap into and observe that feeling of anxiety and try to make out where it is located in your body. Your throat? Your chest? Your gut? After you have a understanding of where it's located, take a look at how exactly it moves through your body. Does it spin, swing or circle around? What kind of shape does it resemble? Does it move fast or slow? Is it turning into a certain direction? Is there a color you'd attribute to it? As soon as you got a decent image of that energy in your body, envision to pull that energy out of your body and put it about one yard in front of you so you can get a better look at it. Take your time observing it. The way it moves, it's shape, color and so on. While that energy keeps moving the way it does, imagine there to be a magic remote control in your hand. With this remote you can freely manipulate the energy in front of you. There's a play/pause button as well as buttons for forward and rewind, as well as different colors to choose from. Press the pause button and observe how the energy gets slower and slower until it finally stops. Now press the rewind button and make it move in the opposite direction. Make it spin a little faster. As a finishing touch, choose a color that's to your liking. Now look at your finished work for a few seconds and put that energy back in your body and feel how it affects you when the energy is moving through your body in this new way. Relish in the experience for a few more seconds. Now take 3 deep breaths before you start to check your emotional state and compare it to before the excercise. There should be a discernable difference. _x000D__x000D_
-----------_x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
If it feels good, repeat the excercise a few times in a row, while imagining the experience as realistically as possible. If there are known triggers, check the emotional response when thinking about that. Did the emotional feedback change compared to before? _x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
If you like this excercise, just keep doing the excercise 3-5 times a day for as long as you see fit. The best time to do it is directly before you go to bed, because in our dreams the subconscious reevaluates the experiences (internal and external) of the day - especially those that triggered strong emotional feedback and what we perceived during the last 60 minutes before we sleep. _x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
Our brains are generalizing thoughts and feelings permanently by creating contextual rules of behavior. Once set these rules seldomly change, unless we experience a different emotional feedback in relation to the data the rules applied to. They determine how we react to things we can perceive internally (thoughts, bodily sensations) or externally (what we see, hear, taste, smell or taste). Fear is just one of the many meanings our minds can give. What this excercise is supposed to achieve, is giving your brain new options of behavior under certain circumstances, creating a different response, by connecting your current perception to a different emotional feedback._x000D__x000D_

Aside from communication that has already been suggested, another thing to consider is to a physical activity together each week. It could be running, gym, tennis or anything that you both may enjoy, but preferable a team sport. Part of the appeal of doing especially team sports together is that you begin to read another persons body language and you'll have other ways aside from words to quell your anxiety. Its also a great way to be independently dependent for a while during the day. Finally, physical exercise is known to lower anxiety in general..so it may be helpful to you as an individual in the long run. Also, consider therapy if you haven't already. This sounds like a great relationship and you both seem to be mature enough to see this all the way through.

One final recommendation, continue writing relationship advice on reddit. I have often found that in giving advice while drawing from my own experiences, often makes me revaluate my own situation from a third persons perspective. So perhaps you may be able to better learn or see your relationship in a new light once you step back.

Good luck!"

Tldr:  I am the mother of a 10 year old with pretty significant GAD. My question is, does your generalized anxiety disorder affect your executive function?

Backstory: I thought my kiddo was showing signs of adhd. I had her evaluated by a licensed psychologist, and was told that she has pretty significant GAD. And coordination disorders called to dyspraxia and dysgraphia.  She has since started counseling and occupational therapy it's going pretty well. One of her... I guess symptoms... Is that, when she's feeling anxious, she gets really snappy, short, and curt with people. We have discovered that it is because she struggles with executive dysfunction. Basically she is so anxious that she doesn't know what to do first, and this causes her to feel like she's backed in a corner and she needs to fight her way out. One of the reasons I thought she might have ADHD was because she can't seem to focus, but her therapist said that it's not that she can't focus on one thing, it's that she doesn't know where to begin and she gets overwhelmed.

We expect a diagnosis of anxiety (generalized or social) but she is currently diagnosed MDD (depression). It is very common for these to overlap/have similar symptoms.

At home she has a sensory/safe space she can utilize when feeling too overwhelmed. However I do encourage her to use in the moment coping strategies before resorting to this. 

My daughter keeps a note book and writes down what triggers her anxiety in the moment; is it noise? too many people? school work? feeling overwhelmed? hungry?
Once we can identify what her triggers are, we can expect and adapt for her. 

One thing that has been very important for her is working on emotional regulation and breathing when she is stressed. It also helps for that anxious ""fight"" energy to have some form of appropriate outlet in the moment; try her with a few fidget toys. Once you know the specific cause there are some other things that can be done too. My daughter gets snappy when she is overwhelmed or there is too much noise, so we break down tasks (instead of clean your room; pick up clothes, done? put books in a pile, put books on shelf, find all your soft toys ect...)  and reduce noise in our home. I'm waiting on some noise reducing headphones for out of home.

At school she becomes TOO overwhelmed by class settings and doesn't have the skill set to deal with it, so we are placing her in the Learning Center for this year as a gentler variation. She has the ability to break from work and use coping strategies including mental wellness worksheets and coloring books. She also keeps fidgets with her for school. 

Some of my favorite exercises to do with her are: Vader breathing/Ujjayi breath (Google videos!), 5-5-5 Grounding (5 things I see, feel, smell), Heart control; place a hand on your chest if your heart is racing and see if you can make it beat slower with breathing. Finger counting; take your thumb and tap each finger. You can make patterns and have her focus on copying your taps herself if it helps her.

The best thing I’ve found is to use the Pomodoro method, where you set a timer for work time, and then afterwards set a timer for break time. For more stressful topics, you can add more break time, for easier topics you add more work time. 

I usually try and do 40 minutes of work time to 5 minutes of break time for easy topics.

I’ll do 25 minutes of work time to 10 minutes of break time for more intermediate topics.

Ill do 15 minutes of work time to 20 minutes of break time for stressful topics.

Your goal in this isn’t to work as fast as you can. Rather it’s to progress at a pace that is consistent and doable for you.

Make notes of your progress after each session to ensure you will meet your deadlines, and commend yourself each step of the way, especially in the face of difficulty or slow progress. 

It doesn’t matter how long it takes you to arrive at your goal as long as you can meet your deadlines.

Start projects early with a clear plan and give yourself some wiggle room. There will be unanticipated hiccups and accounting for these early on makes them less stressful.

I planed a trip to Cabo with some friends a while ago and have just been waiting to see how COVID is going to make the final decision about whether or not to go. With Omicron dying down recently I've been set on going, until I realized that you have to show proof of a negative test to get back into the US. Should have realized this before, but again I kind of only recently decided I was actually going and started looking into travel restrictions.

It's not that I'm so anxious about getting super sick. I'm triple vaxxed and I want to go about living my life. If I get sick then I get sick. What I AM worried about is testing positive and then being stuck in Mexico for who knows how long. I know a number of people who were triple vaxxed and still got COVID and didn't test negative for a week or so. I was only planning to take 3 days off work for this trip and since I've been recently promoted it would be really stressful for me to have a miss a lot more unexpectedly. I also have a jiu jitsu competition I've been working really hard for the weekend following the trip.

I talked to my friends about it and they're not very concerned. Two of them are teachers who have the whole week off and one goes to school remotely, so I think that gives them more leeway. To me it just feels like a big risk and I think I could have a hard time enjoying the trip knowing that I'll have to test at the end and not knowing what the results will be. For that reason, I'm leaning towards not going. I'm worried though that my anxiety is getting in the way of what could be a really fun trip with friends I don't see that often and I'm afraid of missing out.

I‚Äôm a college student with an ESA for my anxiety, depression, and PTSD who has also not had a ton of luck with antidepressants. I got my ESA dog about a year ago and he‚Äôs the best decision i‚Äôve made in a long time. He‚Äôs very cuddly and helps keep my anxiety at bay. Before I had him I had constant daily anxiety, but now that I have him my daily anxiety is much less and I am able to calm down by petting him, cuddling him, or taking him on walks. He‚Äôs also pretty goofy and he always smiles as me when I come home which makes my day so much better. As far as money goes, it is definitely a responsibility but if you adopt an older animal from a shelter (1.5+ years so they are hopefully potty trained and less destructive) and do some basic training with it at home it shouldn‚Äôt be too expensive. I definitely think that my ESA is worth the cost and I‚Äôm a broke college student. For my dog, I spent about $500 upfront after adoption fees (kennel, food, harness, leash, food/water bowl, toys, treats, etc.) and after that most of the expense is for annual shots, other vet bills, food, and treats. As long as you budget and are prepared you should be fine. I will say that ESAs aren‚Äôt for everybody, but I definitely think it was worth it for me.

It's called ""The Movies"" and is a typical FPC(fast phobia cure)-type excercise from NLP, derived from hypnosis-therapy. It's kind of a quick fix to calm the nerves and stimulate our brains to build new neural pathways and has been decently successful in treatment of PTSD and different forms of anxiety. It was one of the first excercises I did to overcome fear of loss and social anxiety and actually worked for me, so I hope you can apply it successfully, too._x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
This is how you do it... _x000D__x000D_
------------_x000D__x000D_
Imagine someone has made a movie about your life and your fear(s) , which you are about to watch at a theatre that's been prepared solely for you. You get your ticket at the counter. You grab something to eat and drink and make your way to the theater. As you walk in you realize it's completely empty. You are the only customer today. Now look for a seat that's to your liking (You recognize it immediately because it's your favorite color) and make yourself comfortable. Is it near the screen, the middle or farther back? Finally the lights are slowly being dimmed and as it gradually gets darker, you begin to feel lighter and lighter, finally elevating out of your body and upward towards the ceiling, where you come to a stop right behind a huge steel beam, that's obstructing your view towards the screen. Try touching the steel with both hands. Is it cold or warm? Now look down at your body in that seat. Look closely at yourself from above and observe that body down there while it watches the movie in your stead. Now the projector is starting. First comes the classic movie countdown 5...4...3...2...1... The movie starts with that MGM Lion intro. It then plays up to the moment right before you'd usually feel fear when suddenly the movie stops and starts playing backwards really fast, like someone hit the rewind button, making the movie run back to the very start. You see the numbers 1,2,3,4,5 when suddenly a yellow rubber duck leisurely crosses the screen, quacking. Did that duck wear any underwear? If so how did it look like?_x000D__x000D_
-----------_x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
Start again from the beginning and repeat reading that text and imagining the experience as realistically as possible (first-person perspective, larger than life, near, colorful, bright and clear) for like 5-6 times in a row. Then check your emotional condition. If there are known triggers, check the emotional response when thinking about that. Did the intensity of the emotional feedback change compared to before? _x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
If you like this excercise, just keep doing it 5 times a day for as long as you see fit. The best time to do that is directly before you go to bed, because in our dreams the subconscious reevaluates the experiences (internal and external) of the day - especially those that triggered strong emotional feedback as well as the thoughts we focus on during the last 60 minutes before we sleep._x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
How does this excercise work? Well... _x000D__x000D_
Our subconscious doesn't differ between data that stems from an inner event (imagination/visualization) and that of an outer event, so imagination can cause the same emotional response as real life experience, if visualized in a very lifelike manner. You probably have experienced that numerous times already by imagining worst case scenarios in your head and getting the emotional feedback of fear. This excercise utilizes these fear-inducing subconscious visualizations, remodels and then connects them to a different emotional feedback. _x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
Our perception of time plays an important role in this excercise as well. All we ever perceive in our daily lives is time moving forward. It's like the ultimate rule. Life doesn't go back in time. So to our subconscious seeing our reality rewind is something abnormal. So it's trying to give meaning to the incoming data and by immediately focusing on something ridiculous like a yellow rubber duck wearing underwear (or not) the scene that once used to hold the meaning of ""dangerous or threatening"" (resulting in fear as feedback), suddenly gets connected to the meaning of ""strange, funny and somewhat nonsensical"", thus triggering the corresponding emotional feedback creating new neural pathways, so our subconscious mind gains a new option of behavior. At least that's the theory._x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
Hope it works for you. Take care üôè‚ù§Ô∏è"

The best thing you cam do is get good sleep (hoping your insomnia is managed), eat healthy, exercise, and practice relaxation techniques like meditation, mindfulness, deep breathing, distracting your mind with hobbies/TV, relaxing, calming imagery, etc. when nerves are stressed like it sounds yours are, it take time to recover and it may be several weeks, so be patient with yourself. You can control your stress and anxiety levels, and time and healing will help your twitching.

This is left field, not a doctor, but you could have an electrolyte imbalance that can cause twitching muscles, maybe try adding potassium to your diet (say eating a banana a day) and see if that helps.

Do you have an existing prescription for meds? If so, go on [www.Goodrx.com](https://www.Goodrx.com) and look for coupons. Xanax, for example, is $10/month. A lot of drug makers also have coupons on their websites.

If you do not have an existing prescription, then you need affordable health care. You can look for low-cost clinics to start. You can try calling a former doctor and telling them that you have a crisis and ask for a prescription. You never know. 

Obviously, apply for jobs so you can get some cashflow. even if it is not the money you want (or need) to make, something is better than nothing and can help you get meds and start to prioritize your survival needs.

Don't worry about the debts for now. Even though they're a black cloud over you, all debts collectors can do is harass you. They'll get the money when they get it--if they get it.

The doctor will be fine if you explain you lied about the reason for your appointment because your parents don't approve of treatment for your anxiety.

About 50% of people find that it changes their lives dramatically, so it's worth trying. Even if it doesn't work first try, you can just try a slightly higher dose every couple of months until you find the dose that works.

Second option - do some research on 'cognitive behavioural therapy'. This is an actual system of treating anxiety, not just random stuff like 'try meditation' or 'try journaling'.

If you are a caffeine user, either quit or cut down, for me this had the biggest effect on reducing these issues. Likewise, try to cut sugar down, stay away from alcohol &amp; drugs, even pot, &amp; just eat healthy in general, make sure to sleep well &amp; to be active (not necessarily exercise, just going for a half hour walk around your neighborhood will work). After that, I find it helpful to connect with the natural world &amp; engage the senses, this helps get you out of your head &amp; into your body. For example, go for a walk in nature &amp; smell the air, feel the plants or ground, pet an animal, that sort of thing. These are all the starting point things I would recommend. If you are still really suffering, I would recommend reaching out to a mental health professional, or even the counselor at your school if they are good. I've personally had a hard time finding a therapist I connected with, but I found the book 'How to stop worrying &amp; start living' by Dale Carnegie very helpful. It sounds cheesy, but it's pretty practical advice imo.

Since the age of 14, it has grown worse. I've tried every type of medication, and I'm currently taking Klonopin and Lamictal. I see a therapist and psychiatrist. I talk to friends and my dad every day. Because of my mental health, I am unable to hold a 9-5 job. On the side, I do background commercials but may have to quit because I feel as though my body is shutting down. Smoking weed helped me a lot until it didn't anymore. Several months after my mom died from undiagnosed cancer, I began experiencing terrible back pain, shoulder pain, and crippling knee pain. I thought it was a sprain but it was nerve pain. Neither weed nor CBD helped. I can barely leave the house now. My symptoms include dizziness, muscle pain, nausea, twitching, spasms, low blood sugar, agoraphobia, cramping, genetic hair loss, neck pain, stomach issues, sound sensitivity, nauseous, and chronic fatigue, and I can't control them. It is so bad that the only thing that helps is sleeping it off, which is not a very good quality of life. Occasionally, I don't even feel anxious when I need to rest or have some quiet time. Even though I used to do all these things like party and hang out with friends before, I still had anxiety, but now I have the same anxiety and cannot function due to my health issues. What is the point in living like this? Because I'm in so much pain, I have to stay home and isolate myself. Nothing works and no one understands. My only medical diagnosis is PCOS, and I'm due for some MRIs on my neck and spine. Let's hope this is simply anxiety.

I have been struggling with anxiety for 3 years with some good periods, some mediocre and a handful of bad periods. Here's a couple of things that I've learned that might be of use.

1) Have you tried psychotherapy? I think medication is helpful but it rarely is when the ''root cause'' is not tackled. Psychotherapy might give you better odds of finding the root cause of your anxiety or atleast know more about yourself and your insecurities.

2) Having dreams/ambitions is really good. I fully understand your chicken/egg problem. One workaround you could try is : setting yourself a moderately challenging yet achievable goal or ambition. For instance, training 3 times a week in order to get fit for military school. Or if that's too much because of medication, tone it down. Say 30 mins walk every day. On the same subject, sports/exercise is usually very good against anxiety, so try to be active (no need to go crazy though).

3) Watch out for anxiety/mental illness information circulating on the internet, especially personal stories like : I have X condition, my panic attacks can be described as Y, I'm always thinking about Z. I don't know for you, but for me reading people's stories regarding anxiety usually scare the shit out of me, because I can tell myself : if that person has that symptom while having a panic attack, maybe I can have that too? Which is a great way to boost your fear. Try to remember that everyone is different and we all have a different story, ergo different symptoms and conditions, even though we all suffer from anxiety.

hope that can help!"

If you have panic attacks, these things will help you take your focus off your panic and bring you back into the present, ending your panic attack a bit quicker:

- Count backwards from 100 by threes, write your name with your non-dominant hand or sing the ABCs in your head, but skip every other letter. This takes enough focus that it takes your mind off your panic and helps end the panic faster.
- Wash your face with ice water; this triggers the diver's reflex. When we dive into cold water, our heartbeat automatically slows, blood moves from the limbs to the chest and breathing slows down. We can trigger this response without actually diving into water. Washing your face with ice water should be cold enough to shock your body and break the pattern of panic. Alternatively, try taking a cold shower.
- Look for things around you: five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, one thing you can taste. It's a grounding exercise, called The Five Senses.
- Inhale deeply, hold your breath for a bit, exhale deeply. Technically [this is the 4-7-8 method.](https://www.healthline.com/health/4-7-8-breathing#How-to-do-it-) Inhale for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 7 seconds, exhale for 8 seconds. The length of time isn't super important, the idea is just to breathe more deeply as panic makes you breathe shallowly and lack of oxygen makes it much worse.

There is one particular song that I loop when I'm anxious or feeling a panic attack coming on or trying to knock myself out of the post-panic hangover: [Be Still by The Killers.](https://youtu.be/Tkv13UC0nHo) It has this magical soothing quality for me, like musical Xanax."

_x000D__x000D_
Both the brain and the GI tract have neurons in them. In fact, some in the medical community call the stomach the 2nd brain._x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
Anyway, the brain can send signals of distress to the GI tract and make the GI tract think it has to do something (like poop). Similarly, you can eat some food that your GI tract doesn't like and it can send a panic message to your brain and make you anxious._x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
So just to confirm: what you're feeling is real. But the need to poop, may be a signal from your brain being anxious (anticipating the bus, for example) making your GI tract think it needs to do something._x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
&gt; Has anyone of you experienced this? _x000D__x000D_

Yes, I have._x000D__x000D_

&gt; I have asked my parents but they think we should consult a normal doctor and they think that it's just my stomach._x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
So, weirdly, it might be your stomach. Or something somewhere else in your GI tract. There's a whole branch of research about the bacteria that co-exist with you in your GI tract and how they also signal to your gut whether things are okay or not. Also, sometimes you can get the wrong type of bacteria in there and that bacteria sends unhelpful signals to your gut as well. _x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
How to diagnose that is tricky and most primary care physicians aren't super knowledgeable on the topic because the concept is rather new and still being heavily researched._x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
If you go to a doctor, they might try to put you on an SSRI, like Lexapro. It's a good drug, but I don't think it'll really solve your problem. It's mostly a drug for reversing depression and anxiety disorders. (Unless you think you actually have an anxiety disorder, then it might be the right drug for you.)_x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
You could talk with a gastroenterologist. They might have a better idea on how to approach the problem. Usually you have to go thru your primary care doctor first before getting referred to a gastroenterologist, though."

So far I've tried Paroxetine, Escitalopram, Venlafaxine, Fluoxetine, Clomipramine, Mirtazapine, Olanzapine, Seroquel, Abilify, Propranolol, and probably some other medications I've forgotten. Some as stand alone medications, some in combination with eachother. None worked. The only thing that does work is a high dosage of Xanax but you can't take that for life. On the therapy side of things I've had Psychotherapy, CBT, EMDR, Talk therapy, and exposure therapy. Nothing worked. I can't live like this, I can't do anything. I can't even cook or change my bed because I'm so anxious. Is there anything else that might help?

About three weeks ago I had severe vertigo for a full week to the point where I couldn’t stand up without feeling like I was going to fall over, I don’t know if it’s related or not. That went away but I am still in constant brain fog feeling where I don’t feel real, I feel dizzy, like I’m gonna fall over, and it just doesn’t stop. I’ve already been to the doctor to see if I have an issue with my ears and my vestibular balance system, nothing was wrong. So now I have to get blood work done just to make sure that it isn’t a health issue. I do think it’s anxiety just because if I distract myself enough the feeling goes away until I remember that I’m supposed to be feeling it and then it comes back. But it’s debilitating.

I have this extreme fear of passing out or having a seizure. So this feeling makes me feel like I am about to have both of those things, though I never have. You would think that that would ease my mind with the amount of times I felt this feeling and nothing has happened, but every time I worry that that moment is going to be the moment where something happens. And it just continues. It’s affecting my life it’s affecting my job I’m literally sitting here thinking about quitting because I haven’t been to work in almost 3 weeks due to this feeling. My job is a great job, it’s full-time, has amazing benefits and decent pay. I can’t afford to lose it but I’m afraid. I do have a slight worry that it is a neurological issue but I don’t know. Today while I was typing, I forgot how to spell the word white and it scared me a lot because I’ve never been that clueless on how to spell such a simple word, so it sent me into an even bigger brain fog attack.

What you describe is probably a very reasonable reaction to a very stressful situation, not *excessive* and unreasonable.

There are various assessments used to determine if someone has an anxiety disorder. If you go to a doctor or licensed therapist, they will administer or ask you to complete a scale such as the [GAD-7](https://www.mdcalc.com/gad-7-general-anxiety-disorder-7), [Trait Anxiety subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T)](https://osf.io/ke9jz/download), [Penn State Worry Questionnaire](https://www.midss.org/sites/default/files/pswq.pdf) and [Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)](https://res.cloudinary.com/dpmykpsih/image/upload/great-plains-health-site-358/media/1087/anxiety.pdf). There are several types of anxiety (generalized, social, PTSD, not otherwise specified, etc) and only a therapist or doctor could give a definitive answer, but this is the diagnostic criteria for **generalized anxiety disorder**, just one of the types of anxiety.

A. Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), ***occurring more days than not for at least 6 months***, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).

B. The individual finds it difficult to control the worry.

C. The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms having been present for more days than not for the past 6 months):

Note: Only one item required in children.

1. Restlessness, feeling keyed up or on edge.
2. Being easily fatigued.
3. Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank.
4. Irritability.
5. Muscle tension.
6. Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless, unsatisfying sleep).

D. The anxiety, worry, or physical symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

E. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism).

F. The disturbance is not better explained by another medical disorder (e.g., anxiety or worry about having panic attacks in panic disorder, negative evaluation in social anxiety disorder \[social phobia\], contamination or other obsessions in obsessive-compulsive disorder, separation from attachment figures in separation anxiety disorder, reminders of traumatic events in posttraumatic stress disorder, gaining weight in anorexia nervosa, physical complaints in somatic symptom disorder, perceived appearance flaws in body dysmorphic disorder, having a serious illness in illness anxiety disorder, or the content of delusional beliefs in schizophrenia or delusional disorder).

\- - -

And for **social anxiety disorder/social phobia:**

A. Marked fear or anxiety about one or more social situations in which the individual is exposed to possible scrutiny by others. Examples include social interactions (e.g., having a conversation, meeting unfamiliar people), being observed (e.g., eating or drinking), and performing in front of others (e.g. giving a speech).

Note: In children, the anxiety must occur in peer settings and not just during interactions with adults.¬†¬†

* The individual fears that he or she will act in a way or show anxiety symptoms that will be negatively evaluated (i.e., will be humiliating or embarrassing; will lead to rejection or offend others).
* The social situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety.

Note: In children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, freezing, clinging, shrinking, or failing to speak in social situations.¬†¬†

* The social situations are avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety.
* The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual threat posed by the social situation and to the sociocultural context.¬†¬†

B. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 months or more.

C. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.¬†¬†

D. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.¬†¬†

E. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better explained by symptoms or another mental disorder, such as panic disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, or autism spectrum disorder.

F. If another medical condition (e.g., Parkinson‚Äôs disease, obesity, disfigurement from burns or injury) is present, the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is clearly unrelated or is excessive.

\- - -

A **panic attack** includes at least four of these symptoms (as you can see above, panic attacks are NOT a requirement for GAD - **panic disorder** is a separate diagnosis and some people do have panic attacks, but don't have them frequently or severely enough to be classed as ""panic disorder"" - panic disorder also has its own criteria that must be met, which is as follows:

A. The individual experiences recurrent unexpected panic attacks, which are abrupt feelings of intense fear or discomfort that reach great heights within minutes, during a time in which at least four of the following symptoms occur:

* Palpitations, pounding heart or quickened heart beat
* Abnormal sweating
* Trembling or shaking
* Instances of shortness of breath or feeling smothered
* Feelings of choking
* Chest pain or discomfort
* Nausea or abdominal pain
* Dizziness, unsteadiness, light-headedness or faintness
* Chills or hot flashes
* Paresthesia (numbness or tingling sensations)
* Derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (feeling detached from his or her self)
* Fear of losing control or ‚Äúgoing crazy‚Äù
* Fear of death

B. One or more of the attacks were followed by a month (or longer) of one or both of the following:

* Persistent worry about having more panic attacks and/or their consequences (e.g., having a heart attack)
* A significant abnormal change in behavior in response to the attacks, such as ones intended to avoid unfamiliar situations.

C. The disturbance cannot be attributed to the physiological effects of a substance, such as a drug or medication, or another medical condition.

D. The disturbance cannot be better explained by another mental disorder, such as social anxiety disorder or specific phobia, which may involve panic attacks.

These things will help you take your focus off your panic and bring your back into the present, ending your panic attack a bit quicker:

- Count backwards from 100 by threes
- Look for things around you: five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, one thing you can taste. It's a grounding exercise, called The Five Senses.
- Inhale deeply, hold your breath for a bit, exhale deeply. Technically [this is the 4-7-8 method.](https://www.healthline.com/health/4-7-8-breathing#How-to-do-it-) Inhale for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 7 seconds, exhale for 8 seconds. The length of time isn't super important, the idea is just to breathe more deeply as panic makes you breathe shallowly and lack of oxygen makes it much worse."

So I've been thinking recently about my life, about how I became the way that I am.
I've been socially anxious and depressed for a long time, I struggle to make friends or even connect with people, despite meeting alot of new people regularly. 
I've been thinking about how I used to be as a kid... It wasn't this hard back then and I used to be way more trusting, optimistic and open with people. 
So what changed? 
Oh yeah, I immigrated to America as a child.

I'm not sure if this is the only reason why I have social anxiety, I believe it's a combination of this and other things, like moving from one city to another and having to rebuild my friend circle over and over again from the beginning. It just becomes exhausting at some point you know? 
I just wish to change and have stable, healthy friendships one day.

I also got pretty bad social anxiety around early middle school, which was unsurprisingly the last time that I made a new friend, and with my only friend going to a different college as me and the fact that we've completely lost touch, I do understand the loneliness.

I'm not sure about particular online resources, but I'm pretty sure that colleges have mental health counselors that can refer you to proper resources and get you the help that you want, so I recommend looking into that. I do believe that they're free, so if your parents are paying for your college, it won't show up on the bill, which may give you a greater sense of privacy.

As for social interactions, I'd say just kinda force yourself to at least attend some events where social interaction is possible if you feel comfortable enough to make that step. Clubs are probably the best option since you can actually be around people who have a similar interest as you, and it might help with the self-consciousness since you would have some degree of certainty that they'll be interested in listening to what you're saying. I recommend checking out smaller clubs since it might be somewhat less intimidating compared to larger ones and give you more opportunity for actually meaningful social interaction.

As I walk towards the noise, I'm greeted by an aunty in-law or distant cousin's partner that I've only said ""hi"" and ""bye"" to. My palms begin to sweat as I think of relevant topics to converse in. 

I'm soon directed to a long table full of eyes waiting to greet me. I do the awkward rounds as I find myself locked in a seat for the evening. No escape now! 

""So how's work been?!"" Someone shouts at me from across the far end of the table, making sure to collect everyone's attention on the way. Fuck - how do I make my dead end job sound engaging for all to hear..

As we wrap up dinner, the music starts blazing and the alcoholics start to move. ""Why are you standing there so awkwardly? Come dance"" they slur as they stumble side to side. 

---------------

I'm so done with this shit. Why can't it be socially acceptable for people like me to just not go to these things? Why can't I just see the people I care about when I/they want to?

I ended working with a friend of my on a really shit job that sometimes didn't even pay me. But I was there to not feel so useless, so I really didn't care.

Eventually I got confident on it. And notice that I was one of the smart guys there since it was a shitty job that payed very poorly. Eventually I left and started a decent career as a software developer. I consider myself to be quite successful today career wise. 

But answering your question, if you should be ashamed or not. I guess it depends on the values of the person you are asking to. I am proud of my career and I like to judge others based on their careers's success, so for me it's really easy to say you should feel ashamed. But my values are not necessarily the correct ones.

anyway, now i'm in highschool and i have this friend group. we all get along so well and everything and i love all of them. the problem is i'm scared of talking to some of my friends individually. i'm afraid they'll notice i don't fit in as well as they thought i did, or that they'll see my lack of social skills. we usually all hang out together so there isn't much pressure or that much attention on me, plus the dynamic established is very comfortable and familiar for me.

but today it's only gonna be the just the 3 of us in school. 
and me and ""sam"" both are going to leave just after a few lessons. he asked me if i'm coming home straight after or if i'm doing anything special. and i don't know how to respond. 

i'm so worried about going but also not going. because he's the funniest person i know, and one of my closest friends in the group. i'm scared he'll realise we don't get along as well as we should and then drift away.

So I’ve been getting a lot of coworkers joking about how I’m so quiet. Lately there’s been lots of jokes about me being a murderer. “Watch out for the quiet one,” “Don’t get on her hit list,” etc. 
I try to brush it off but damn I hate being this way. My brain is just frozen at work and besides the regular ‘script’ that I use with customers, I can’t converse worth a damn. 
Anyone else have a good way of dealing with/responding to this type of thing while at work?

i do get quite a lot of anxiety from knowing my voice is broadcast to the public though, because i can‚Äôt stand my own voice, at least i couldn‚Äôt when i first started making vids. now i‚Äôm kinda used to it, but it still makes me nervous knowing it.

as for streaming, i‚Äôve found it to be a bit easier than making videos, but that‚Äôs mainly because i get like 3 viewers the whole stream and that‚Äôs all. i‚Äôve had times when i‚Äôve gotten like 10 viewers, and thats usually when i start getting extremely nervous. i can handle one or two chatters, but 5 or more people actively talking about what i‚Äôm doing (and my bad game skills) can be pretty stressful. 

i‚Äôve been doing it for 2 years though, so i‚Äôve gotten more used to it over time. that‚Äôs probably the biggest thing honestly. if you keep at it, it‚Äôs likely that eventually you‚Äôll get used to the thought of other people watching your videos.

that‚Äôs mostly all the advice i can give. i‚Äôve had a few loyal followers that have stayed with me for more than a year, and they‚Äôre the real reason i keep uploading and streaming. hopefully you find some people like that who can keep you motivated and give you reassurance! best of luck!"

3) focus on the colour of the disk (for me it is usually red) and change it to a colour you associate with calm eg. Yellow. Focus on the yellow slowly spinning disk._x000D__x000D_

They both are perfect for one another (they like and believe the same things). We met her because of her business and this was the first time we've hung out socially.

We talked the whole time, and in the moment I felt fine, but after it all I started getting worried about the future of our friendship.

She has a very strong personality and based on what we were talking about alone, I could see her talking bad about me behind my back if I made one mistake. Because of this, she's not someone I would normally mingle with in the first place; she's more my sister's type. I'm really only friends her because I'm close with my sister and we get along. But I do worry about disagreeing with her because she seems so set in her ways and I feel like I would have to be the one making a compromise (because I always am).

Maybe I'm having flashbacks to being pressured to be a ""yes"" man to my old ""friends"" in middle school and I don't want to be in that kind of one-sided relationship again. Maybe it really is just all in my head and my thoughts are being irrational. Maybe I've just been caught up in this friendship I never would have initiated on my own and having a hard time dealing with it. Maybe I'm just being selfish and trying to take the easy way out. I can't tell.

I was reminded of why I avoid making friends in the first place, which is because I assume everyone will hate me if they got to know me. So I'm afraid of becoming one more person in her list of people she hates, especially because when she hates someone, she *hates* them.","Afraid New Friend will Hate Me if she Doesn't Already","Help","hpjy8pn","Overall_Sandwich_671","/r/socialanxiety/comments/rm4106/afraid_new_friend_will_hate_me_if_she_doesnt/hpjy8pn/",1,1640179812,"You don't have to be friends with her just because she's your sister's friend.

I was civil with them, sure, but I didn't form attachments to them. I eventually learned I am capable of making my own friends.

This woman sounds like a very black and white person. She probably reacts strongly to things that don't particularly bother you (this is just the impression I'm getting) and this is probably where you and she are going to clash. You probably feel that she has the stronger personality because she speaks up more frequently, But she probably does have her own insecurities, and covers them up by being outspoken.

I'm not really sure what sort of advice to give you, but if she does give you any shit, take a breath, don't immediately blame yourself for her outburst, and take on a laid back ""I don't really give a fuck what you think"" attitude towards her.","t3_rm4106","t3_rm4106","socialanxiety","reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/rm4106/afraid_new_friend_will_hate_me_if_she_doesnt/","https://www.succeedsocially.com","I can only give you a fact and my experience..._x000D__x000D_

27F, been on and off the apps for years. I’ve tried them all, I’m now trying bumble because the guys that have been reaching out to me I wasn’t interested in (luck still sucks). The one time I dated a guy for a few months, I wanted it to end because I feel like I settled due to lack of physical attraction. Now, I’ve been on bumble for a brief while and met up with two guys. The first guy seemed to like me but I didn’t like him. I just met up with another guy, we talked for a few hours and he seemed interested in meeting up again. I enjoyed talking to him I’m just not sure if I would want to take it any further, part of me is kind of interested in going out a second time but I remember how I settled for the last guy I saw for a few months. I ended up seeing the second guy Saturday and was kind of irritated by him, he ended up saying that he wasn’t feeling it from me &amp; thinks it won’t work out. I wouldn’t have gone out again but it’s the fact that he ended things first. I want the romance from dating, just a little note that I don’t really have sexual desire. I like the thought of intimacy like kissing etc but I don’t masturbate and haven’t had sex in years. Could that contribute to my lack of success? Or am I just not meeting the right guys? I feel like dating shouldn’t be this hard, my life is all about shutting down the ones I don’t want &amp; the ones I do want don’t feel the same way. Social anxiety is also behind why it’s that much harder but only so much. 

TL; DR: Bad luck in love or am I the culprit?

I'm going to say that the *best* thing you can do is find a driving instructor who fits you. My first instructor was a terrible fit and I almost gave up entirely, but I reached out to a second instuctor and the difference it made was incredible. Finding somebody calm and who you feel at ease with is essential, and that could take time all of its own. But, as far as I can tell the majority of driving instructors are calm/have nerves of steel and are fairly social people.

I will say that I was lucky - I picked a driving instructor that *specialised* in SEN/anxiety, so it was easy for me to be open with him and he eased me in to the whole driving thing. Although you might not be able to find the same, it is *always* worth checking. Even if, say, you choose based on gender, or what they say about themselves.

Secondly, yes, doing the final tests with a stranger is terrifying. I forgot how to start the car and made *a lot* of mistakes my first time. Huge mistakes. It felt awful failing, but the next time I did the test it was a lot easier. But, again, not only was I calmer I also had a far friendlier examiner. We got along well. I passed with very few minors that time, mostly for hesitation.

The first time I went for gas was frightening but by the third or forth time it was just routine. You'll do it a lot and it *does* get easier. You're just one of hundreds of strangers those peope are serving, so chat is always at a minimum anyway - unless you're paying by the pump, then no contact required. And... the likelihood of you having to stop for the police is extremely small. I've had to move out the way of emergency services maybe three or four times in three years of driving.

And please don't worry about time. Yes, driving will open up your world, but you've got to move at your own pace. All you need is an hour or two a week (at least here) to learn, which can easily be fit in around a job or study. Sometimes we need to build up to things. For example, it isn't the same, but I would have been too anxious to learn how to drive if I hadn't done the theory first.

I actually really hate driving but I can say is that it's a self-contained space where you're in control, and that's always a bonus."

I’ve had many thoughts like “What would happen if I killed myself” I think how peoples reactions would be. I think about if they would even care and who would care more, if they would really miss me. I’ve gone through scenarios in my head like I can’t do it anymore and I search for help and I like feeling like people care. Sounds super selfish, I know. But basically I imagine my therapist and parents wanting to help and be worried about me (meaning they care) and I like that feeling, feeling that others care. My parents do care about me like they feed me and give em all I need. They don’t quite understand mental health though… not really their fault though. 

Im NOT going to kill myself. I’m excited and looking forward to date, get married, get a career, and start my own family. No matter how hard it gets I won’t do it because I know it can hurt others and lead them to do dumb things too.


If I were to tell my therapist about these thoughts and feelings would she tell my parents even though I tell her I won’t do it? Is there a chance she’ll still think y life is in danger and tell them? Because in reality I don’t want anyone to know my parents would be mad and think I’m crazy probably. They’ll say stuff like “god have you this life and you need to be thankful” which will only make em feel worse because I know it’s true.


Im just so stuck and feel so sad I want more people in my life to care about me.

She said I seemed disinterested and she left feeling horrible and drained having to fill every awkward silence. She was trying really hard and was very bubbly.

we texted in between all seemed good we had another call I tend to have a monotone/flatline voice which she noted came across as disinterest

Here's how to meditate. Just observe anything with complete neutrality. Then focus on something, like your breath or the clicks of a clock. Whenever random thoughts or emotions distract you from your breath, really feel the emotion with complete neutrality, and for some reason, it helps you detach from your anxiety. In other words, don't be anxious about anxiety. Allow your body to have anxiety, let it run its course, and simply observe it. Then return to your breath and repeat the process. Don't try to force the distractions away: they are part of the process and just as important as the focusing part.  _x000D__x000D_

Recently I realised that I neglect my relationships, and I should become more vulnerable.
So I installed an app that reminds me to take initiative to text/contact them.
It's a start.

Except it also became clear to me why I wouldn't text them. The anxiety and selfhate becomes unbearable at points. The calmness I feel when I go completely detached from social life is so toxic.
My brain doesn't reward me for taking these fake risks at all.

I don't know if I can keep up, for years I've been trying to push myself and I'm scared I've found my limit, and that this limit is not something that I'm proud of.

When I wake up, I'm relaxed for a few minutes, but then it returns. The doubts from yesterday. My brain always finds something to be anxious about and it doesn't seem to distinct between small or big ""problems"".

It's frustrating. I'm a social person. I need social interaction to get out of my head. Yet it brings me so much stress too.

What helps me here (most of the time) is to ""sit"" with the negative emotion and not to try to push it or explain it away. What are you feeling in your body while thinking of that situation? Are you clenching your jaw? Are your shoulders feeling stiff? Is it harder to breathe? Are your hands tingling or feeling hot or cold? What kind of bodily sensations do you feel? Focus on your different body parts and try to describe them as accurately as possible. This helps me to take the immense force of that negative feeling and make it something more simple (i.e. the reaction of my body)._x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
Another - easier - technique is breathing slowly. The rule is: Breath out for at least 6 seconds. I count this way: ""1 Mississippi, 2 Mississippi, ..."" as to not rush my counting. Do the slow breathing until your body calmed down and you can naturally fall in the slow breathing rhythm._x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
Both these techniques help to calm down your nervous system, which is in an agitated state. And to focus your attention on something else than these repeating (unhelpful) thoughts. _x000D__x000D_

It takes courage.

It is absolutely normal to feel nervous/unable to communicate properly when you like someone. At this point you are high with emotion, and thinking clearly will require more mental focus/strength to get you point across. Everyone whom I know has went through this.

That being said, here are some things I learned to consider when dealing with a crush.

 Making the effort to communicate. When I'm around louder, seemingly more confident people, I do the following: ask about them (what they like, what they believe in) and listen. Letting people talk about themselves (AND REMEMBERING WHAT THEY SAY TO YOU) makes you memorable in their eyes. Plus you get to learn new and sometimes cool things. Another tip would be if you've seen something they like to do on social media, ask ""Hey, what's your opinion on (insert subject matter)?""

Assessing your way of thinking. How you see yourself and the world will define the quality of your life. Why do you think this person is out of league? Do you actually think you are not good enough? Say if this person were to not acknowedlge you, how you you really feel? I suggest refraining from putting anyone on a pedestal. If you do, you are giving another human being just like you all the power in the world. We are all people at the end of the day, capable of laughing, crying, and dealing with strengths and insecurities.

Master the art of thinking logically when emotionally high. If I asked you to speak to someone who you aren't attracted to, you can say anything that comes to mind. It's a whole new ballgame when you like the person a lot. You will have to try harder and push yourself more on a mental level. This also applies when you are sad, angry, etc. The ability to think and act clearly when filled with emotion is an invaluable skill when it comes to life. Regardless of the outcome, look to focus on the experience to see how you deal with the emotion, and make the effort to speak with this person like you would anyone else. Making the effort now will give you more confidence for future moments with this person or anybody you have feelings for.

Being aware of the reality that this may be an infatuation that can go as quickly as it came. Many crushes and dates don't lead to long term relationships. People fall in and out of love so quickly it's nuts. One minute you or they may be very interested in the other , then after one conversation or meetup, you or they may lose interest in each other. This happens a lot more than one thinks. So accepting this fact is important as unless you are extremely lucky, there is a high likelyhood you will come across this reality. Don't get discoruaged if this happens to you or the other person. I suggest trying to look at this situation as a way to learn more about yourself, what you really want in partner, and to find at least at least two positive notes about you speaking to/dating someone you like (the fact that you are showing the coruage and initiative to try to speak to this person is an immediate point).

I know I said a lot but I hope some of this helps you out. Don't sell yourself short. We all have something to offer. Good luck, from a guy who has been diagnosed with anxiety and depression, and who is now happily married 8 years to a lovely person.","t3_rsld37","t3_rsld37","socialanxiety","reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/rsld37/dating_lifetalking_to_new_people/","https://www.succeedsocially.com","Not social anxiety. _x000D__x000D_

Neither of us had previously used these emojis in our convos (we did exchange a few ""💞s"" during Christmas holidays, though), and she solely uses stuff like different colored hearts (blue, brown etc) when tagging her male friends in stories.

So far so good, but I should point out how nothing really happened before that text exchange. Tonight's party got really lame after certain people got pointlessly pissed at our group and there were no ""chill"" or decent moments to just sit down and have a nice talk before. We walked to the party together because of a small accident, and that was like, the best part of the whole night, since we really got going. We later created each other's Mii avatar as well, which was kinda cute. Unfortunately, she had to go home earlier than pretty much everyone else because of... overprotective parenting, lmao.

For context: she's a very introvert and inexperienced ""girly girl"", not having had any sort of relationship beforehand. After all, her besties warned me the journey would've been long and exhausting. With that said, she's very charismatic, mentally sharp and self-aware, and I really doubt she hasn't noticed my blatant flirting yet or that she's just playing with my feelings for her.

So, recently I got a new job working at one of the nearby university athletic departments. I read the job description and it was all stuff I had done before. Normal cleaning duties, basic upkeep, etc. In this case clearly being bathrooms, rooms, offices, locker rooms, etc. I didn’t think much of it. I started last week and a lot of what I do is cleaning womens sports locker rooms. I’m a 20(M) for context. I didn’t think much again until my coworker told me that they have had people not care and just undress in front of them, make and female. Also, they said sometimes when I always announce “maintenance” people will simple not answer.

 This made me get lots of really bad anxiety because now I just imagine a girl walking in on me and undressing and then it being my fault, or I walk in on a girl that failed to tell me she was there. There are no cameras or anything obviously, so I just have so much worry I’m going to get blamed for something that I tried to prevent and lose my job and worse stuff happening. 

What should I do? I don’t want to leave the job.

It might sound pathetic, but it can be draining to spend so much time on all of the things which you, probably, think hinder you in life and I'm saying that as someone who can deal with a lot of things in a very busy job. I'd say it's common to feel defeated after having sessions because it feels like talking can't do anything and any goals they give you, you don't think you can manage them, so you feel like you're never going to get anywhere and you might even start to feel pre-session stress or anxiety if you then start to dread that sense of defeat you know will come from your next session, as it seems counter productive to achieving any sort of positive outcome.

Like someone will have said, it is possible that some people just don't work for you, and you may need to say that and try and find someone else. It can be difficult if it's the only person you've seen, because you have no one to compare to, so don't know if you and that person just don't work, or if it's sessions in general that don't work for you. Also the fact that it can be so hard and take so long to see someone, you might not want to throw that away, but spending many sessions with someone that doesn't work can be counter productive and leave you with a negative outlook towards sessions in future.

In terms of them setting goals or objectives, you could always discuss your thoughts with them. If you feel like the objective is unachievable, tell them. If you feel like you will come to the next session without having achieved your goal, tell them. It may be a negative mindset leaving you unable to see the possibility of you ever achieving anything, which could be a confidence issue. It may be that the objective is too vague; if the aim they gave you is literally ""be assertive"", tell them you need something more specific to take smaller steps, rather than trying to adjust such a wide concept. Maybe it could be ""say yes when it's appropriate when otherwise you may have said no"" or, likewise, ""say no to someone you might have otherwise said yes to just to be polite/didn't want to turn down"" or ""interrupt someone, as politely as possible, but firmly, if you have a counter thought to something they are saying rather than wait for them to finish and then ask for your input"" or ""put yourself forward for something you know you have the ability to do, even if you don't think you have the confidence to do it"". All of those things would amount to you being more assertive, without prescribing the ""aim"" of ""being more assertive"" and then you don't have to worry about this vague concept of ""being assertive"" without any tangible things to actually put into practice.","t3_pxapts","t3_pxapts","socialanxiety","reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/pxapts/is_it_normal_to_feel_worse_after_a_couple_of/","https://www.succeedsocially.com","Hi William, I‚Äôm so sorry you feel that way!_x000D__x000D_

They then ask me how things are going for me, making little critical interjections about my career choices and relationship.

Here are some resources that have helped me and may help you since you're asking._x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
First, read / learn about Social Anxiety (SA), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and Exposure Therapy used for SA.  Kati Morton on YouTube is helpful. Kati explains CBT: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=g7B3n9jobus.  Dr. Aziz Gazipura's YouTube channel as well as his book ""..Solution to Social Anxiety"" helped me a great deal. His books explains what SA is, your 'inner critic,' and later how to use CBT &amp; exposure therapy to overcome SA. Check out, the CBT work sheets from Oxford's ""Managing Social Anxiety"": https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/mobile/view/10.1093/med:psych/9780195336696.001.0001/med-9780195336696-appendix-2. I still write something like form 7.1 often. CBT will help you deal w/ your negative thoughts in a healthier way.  _x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
Second, improve your overall feelings of Self-Esteem / Confidence. Read Dr. Nathaniel Brandon's ""Six Pillars of Self-Esteem."" Youtube has the whole audiobook as well as summaries. Don't let the maybe cheesy title put you off. It's good. Also, Robert Burns 'Feeling Good' is ok._x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
Third, learn more about dating. Read Mark Manson's ""Models."" Basically, self improvement, no attachment to outcome, honesty, and vulnerability are key in dating. Read Dr. Robert Glover's two dating books._x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D_
Fourth, you're young. Yes, 18 is young. You can learn new skills, knowledge, interests, hobbies, etc. It's a matter of time &amp; work. What's something you want to learn how to do? Spend 15 - 90 min. a day learning it and in a few years you'll be proficient. Also, I don't want to send you down a deep ""red pill"" hole, but dating should not be anywhere near a top priority in your life. ""Pursue excellence, not women"" to paraphrase Rich Cooper. If you're successful, confident, etc. women will pursue you at a certain point / age. _x000D__x000D_

You can change you just need resources, Time, Work, and patience. ""Break a Leg."""

I struggle with simple decision making, and the anxiety around making a decision under social and time pressures can totally suck.

As you are already seeing a therapist, there is no reason you cant bring this up with them if it is something that is bothering you. It sounds like you generally manage it quite well, but these things can happen sometimes. A therapist could give you some more/better coping techniques.

Personally, I have worked out my general go-to options that I'll have as a fallback if i cant decide on food. I know this isnt the best as it doesnt really address the anxiety but it gets me through if I'm really struggling.

I live in a country w affordable healthcare and so at certain ages you get free treatment. Because of that, they usually book the standard appointments. I think it’s every year or every other year. You can ofc book if you have current issues.

I’m so scared that my current dentist will think that I’m exaggerating symptoms or that I’m trying to be a fraud and get something that I don’t deserve. That I’m just wasting the country’s money when others need it more.

I just can’t reciprocate that amount of socializing, and I don’t know how to tell her that. She knows I struggle with social anxiety, but she doesn’t know I feel it even with her. I think seeing her everyday has affected my social anxiety in a negative way, and I just don’t know how to tell her to stop hanging out around me so much.

I have always been one. Even though I know it, so it should be easy to fix, you would think, but it is not easy. Often people take advantage of such personalities. Or Sometimes I may take a loss to myself to help someone gain. Feeling approval from others is always very prevalent. As in even if someone is putting me down, I would just stay quiet or even smile as if I didn't hear or understand. Which only makes you look weak and foolish to others.

People with this type of personality are not respected by the world.  They are the people that others might take advantage of, or feel sorry for. Being overly nice does not make people melt for you. What should a person do? it seems so easy, but easier said then actually done. When you have Social Anxiety.

Recently I realized that even though I have been a pushover all my life. Now people seem to treat my kids and wife with the same attitude that they treat me. Probably because they think I wont stand up to them anyway, so they don't think twice. This is very disturbing to me. Realizing that others would treat my family with low respect because that's the expectations ""I"" have set to them.

I'm looking to break out of the Pushover personality. I'm 33 and have been one al my life, so don't know how that's gonna happen. I would never be a jerk or bully. But if only I could stand up for myself. 

Have you guys ever experienced this, and did you ever attempt to turn the page on it, with or without success?

Disclaimer: don’t expect magic results the first time you do this. It takes practice.

There’s loads on google if you search ‘personal mantra for anxiety’ or ‘anxiety affirmations’

Also, some people prefer ‘I am’ type mantras, others prefer ‘you are’. How we speak to ourselves in our heads has a big impact so it’s something to pay attention to.

Working a solo shift may be difficult when you‚Äôre new to the store, I‚Äôd just clarify with your supervisor or manager what to do in different situations. With difficult returns etc we have a company customer service helpline to get guidance from, or listen to their issue and take down contact details to get someone more senior to call them the next day, but I guess that depends on your store/ managers preferences and what you have been trained to do so far. _x000D__x000D_

If there‚Äôs a particular situation you‚Äôre worried about, ask the other staff if they can grab you and show you the process when it happens so you can learn, it shows enthusiasm!_x000D__x000D_

15M, this is a burner account. In elementary/middle school, I was an outgoing kid and I made a lot of friends in  my school. I felt really comfortable around my peers and actually enjoyed school. Over COVID, my family made the decision to move across the country. When I started my 8th grade year, I was so socially awkward, nothing like I was before. I would hardly say anything in an entire school day, and whenever someone would talk to me my face would get really red and I wouldn’t know what to say. This behavior continued throughout the whole year, I didn’t manage to make a single friend. I never knew what to say when someone tried to talk to me. Going into my high school year, I thought it was going to be different. After all, nobody knew each other so everybody would be trying to make friends. I was wrong. Although I talked a bit more in class, I am still insanely awkward. I think my issue is that it’s really difficult for me to express my thoughts. I can think of something perfectly good in my head, but when I try to convey that thought I sound like a moron. I also get really confused on simple social queues. For example, when somebody waves at me, I try to smile and wave back but I end up looking really stupid and I get really flustered. I also have no clue how to go up to somebody and start a conversation. Eye contact is also really confusing for me, like when I look around the classroom and I try to avoid looking at people but then the deliberate avoidance makes me look like more of a creep. I really want to make friends, because it’s already halfway through my freshman year and I haven’t gone out a single night. I really hate school right now just because I feel like such a social outcast.

That’s already a big step worth celebrating. I think you did great being honest with him about your anxiety and how you’re trying to step out of your comfort zone, and to be honest I’m more concerned about his lack of sympathy and understanding. You didn’t do anything wrong, and telling you you were being difficult was completely out of line; it’s not like you were purposely choosing to avoid him. If you didn’t explain about your anxiety I can see how he might have been a bit taken aback by your reaction, but you did explain and he still didn’t react kindly which raises a bit of a red flag for me.  
That said, if you’d still like to give him another shot (and please keep in mind you deserve nothing less than someone who is understanding of your social anxiety and supportive of you!) you could try starting out the call with your camera off, then maybe after you’ve eased into the conversation a bit turn it on. Or you could just plan to have the camera on for a short, predetermined amount of time. If the idea of doing the entire video call with the camera on is overwhelming, try something like 1 minute at a time, or whatever increment would be slightly challenging, but still doable, and do your best to stick to it. Then, increase that amount little by little over time.   
Whatever you decide, let him know in advance so he knows what to expect and remember that you’ve done nothing wrong. If he still doesn’t react with understanding, it’s not your job to try to convince him, and it may not feel like it now, but I promise there are other people out there who would be kinder and more patient.

I play Animal Crossing and The Sims 4. Building houses and creating characters specifically calms me. I suppose it depends on the game and how we each react to it, too. For example, my SO plays COD and that would definitely not calm me down, lol.

Like someone else said, I am careful to walk the line between playing games as a tool and playing games as an escape (as in the way I would smoke or use drugs or drink). I think it all comes down to these and probably more factors.

I say go for it and see how you feel. Just stay aware of how you use games and I think you should be fine. I love gaming and the way it soothes me! Good luck :)"

In elementary and middle school I would either pretend to eat or not eat anything at all, and in high school I just skip lunch entirely and do my homework in the library. I justify it by telling myself I’m being more productive, but the truth is my stomach starts rumbling as the day goes on. It feels like everyone is staring and judging me when I do eat in public, looking at what I eat, the way I eat, the fact that I, the shy kid, am eating, etc, so it’s just too embarrassing. I don’t have an eating disorder or body image issues really, and I’m skinny so it’s not an issue of my weight. Also, even if I did eat, I wouldn’t have any friends to sit with.

My point is that it's something that you naturally learn, alone sometimes, or through the proper entourage (which you have to find yourself). Even though you turn 18, people aren't gonna tell you ""Nope you're an adult now, you deal with it alone"".  Sure, legally you turned into an adult, but it's pretty clear when someone is confused/lost because of a lack of experience, and unless you're surrounded by assholes, people will help you.

I guess I expect them to work with my shyness but nobody ever really wants to and coming out and saying “I’m just a shy person” would make me even more shy.

To cope with this, I usually ask at the very end of lectures to the professor personally. I haven’t had professors that were not willing for questions at the end. You can also save them and ask on office hours.

For courses that require participation points (I have this course that takes 30% of your grade from discussion), I usually do the readings 1-2 day before and make sure I write not just the main facts but also conversation topics or questions. By being prepared already with these items I can just read them off and fake it as if I was asking naturally.

Okay so I really enjoy boxing and up until recently I was in a small class for it.
I went with my sister and I was able to practice with her instead of a complete stranger.
She decided that she would quit until I ‘got my act together’ and ‘stopped being a bitch’.
I don’t see how I could’ve come across like that that, to me, I act completely normal.
Now that she has quit boxing, I can’t go anymore because I would have to fight a stranger.

I still get upset about this because that was one of the things that made me actually happy, what I don’t understand is how she expected us to repair our relationship if she has taken away my source of enjoyment and the only time I leave the house other than school.

The real benefits from ""therapy"" for me have been finding a good book, and going through the process, and doing the exercises myself.

One approach is cognitive behavioural therapy. /r/CBT is a good resource. David Burns books and podcasts are often recommended in that sub.

Another is acceptance and commitment therapy. /r/acceptancecommitment is good, if a little quiet. ""The happiness trap"" is often recommended in that sub. I haven't gone through that one yet, but i did read DARE by Barry McDonagh which i found immensely helpful."

It‚Äôs hard to be open externally if inside you are beating yourself down. An amazing gift with anxiety is often the ability to empathize (sometimes too deeply) with others. So, when involved in a conversation, don‚Äôt focus on what you should say; instead, focus on how the other person must feel about themself. Turn your thoughts to their struggles and empathize with their problems. You can even pretend that this person is facing the same problems as you, and you are helping them be open.

Of course, if you could speak to a counselor or therapist, I'm sure it would very much help you cope with these feelings and fears, but until then just here to offer you a little sympathy and support. I have a milder form of this (also lose appetite, feel physically unwell, etc.), It really sucks.  :(_x000D__x000D_
BUT, good news - I've slowly been learning how to deal with it, and so I believe you can too! There's no need to judge or hate yourself for feeling the way you do, not at all. It's the reaction you have when you feel you need to protect yourself from future/possible hurt (for example, that she'll leave or reject you) - it is just a very natural and useful self-preservation mechanism. It might be a little overactive in our cases but I've found that it helps to think about where this fear is coming from (trauma, past abandonment, low self esteem, etc.) and try not to act on that fear but rather consciously practice a habit of trust (I trust her not to hurt me, or leave me; I trust that she means it when she says she loves me; etc.) Slowly, being very gentle and kind to yourself, you can start to address those underlying causes. In the meanwhile though, when you start to have those fears and anxieties, try to notice or recognise them for what they are - reactions to triggers, in order to preserve yourself - before they really start spiralling. Pause at that initial moment, breathe, and practice telling yourself that you are good enough to be loved as you are, you are capable and strong enough to be well even if things go badly, you are worthy of her attention and time and effort, and that it might take some time to build trust in your relationship, but that's alright, give yourselves that time. Also, think of asking for her help as teamwork with your girlfriend, keep doing the communication stuff you wrote about, it is excellent! :) I don't know if any of this helped, but I truly hope you can be comfortable and joyful in your relationship... and wish you the very best! üå∏"

I’m a freshman in college and have been really struggling socially. My roommate came with friends and barely talks to me, yet has them over and doesn’t introduce me. She’s also the meanest roommate and person ever. I met some people the first week but they never reached out to me to do anything so I assumed they didn’t want me around and I stopped reaching out.

I tried sorority recruitment to meet people even though it’s not for me. I thought it could at least be an easier way to make friends, but I got dropped by all of them before I even finished the process.

So now I’m at my lowest of lows and I have no clue what to do. I love a lot of things about my school, but I’m realizing that maybe the people here aren’t for me. I’ve thought about transferring, but my mind is just all over the place.

Im in my 40s now, so I feel you but I'm ahead of you and have some experience to share.

You probably talk to girls way more than I ever had the juevos to. In college I was a D1 athlete at a Pac12 university, and then I somehow became friends with all the cool kids at the university. Still, I was terrified of girls.

I thought some of them were attracted to me. But my internal critic would not allow it.

Here is an idea, if you go out in a social setting use the following: The Two Look Rule. If you make eye contact with a female, then after you both look another direction and you make eye contact again ... then (and this is why its called a ""rule"") you MUST try to talk to her. 

She may have accidentally looked your way a second time, but the odds of that are low. So if you want to try initiating communication with girls when you feel uncomfortable about it, at least we can narrow the odds in your favor.

Here is some more sage advise that cannot go wrong:  go for it!

If you don't go for it, okay. Don't beat yourself up. I spent many years wanting nothing more than to have someone to love, cuddle with and build a life together. I married a girl whose friend asked me to dance with her friend. 

To this day, I have never asked a girl out on a date. Not proud of that. You should not want that. But you also should not dwell and despair about it.

You don't have to return to the past. Whatever mistakes you make right now, you can always fix them rather than go back in time and changing it. Sometimes, even if you did the right thing, not everything will fall into place.

What helps me is knowing that hilariously, whatever I choose, I'd still be plagued with anxiety anyway. So, if I make mistakes, I fix them or I change how I view them. If I don't, and things still don't fall my way, I know to take different routes in the future.

Know that nothing is set in stone. Sometimes you're here right now so that something else better might happen. 

And i know this sounds superbly optimistic, but it has happened to me several times that I realise following my gut instinct is key. People like us with anxieties, have sharper gut instincts (because we think about everything too much). So if you followed, and things screw up, there must be something else you're missing. If you didn't, and it screwed up, know to follow your gut instinct next time, but always try to either fix the mistake or change your perspective of it. 

It's not easy to do, it takes time, and a lot of therapy. You gotta make it a habit, and it'll slowly feel better over time. There are no shortcuts to feeling better, just time and learning more about yourself :)

Its totally frustrating. Your feelings of frustration are totally valid. And I'm not just blowing smoke, I have been dealing with the very same feelings for at least a couple of decades (I'm in my 40s).

You don't have to do anything, but I can ask you to do me a favor:

* Come to grips with that feeling that everyone ""dislikes"" you. Not possible because everyone disliked me first. =) You are not universally disliked. You may feel that way, and whatever you feel is (unfortunately sometimes) as real as any object you can set your hands on. Feelings can suck sometimes.
* Those voices can be scary. Mine tells me to solve social discomfort by drinking alcohol. DON'T DO THAT. I  can almost recite the voices doing battle in my head: ""fix this yo, just a couple glasses"" vs. ""oh no, fuck that bro ...""
* Your statement about ""other thoughts"" concerns me. I mean it when I say this: If no one else cares, I do. 
* I strongly recommend seeking therapy. And I'm saying that as someone who resisted it for decades. There are no quick fixes. But honestly, just having to think about how to explain your problems, then actually verbalizing them to someone - once you trust them - is super valuable.

I can recall many incidents from the past where I used to join various social clubs to participate in activities but as the things went better I always turned my back to people I met there and went my own ways.

Dialect is a different thing so I guess that's why I'm not so confident to speak with my family in it because I can easily mix my dialect with too many formal Arabic words.

If I‚Äôm familiar enough with the store, I‚Äôll list everything by the way I‚Äôd shop through the building. The list keeps me from wandering aimlessly and becoming overwhelmed. Neither things help me get up and go to the store as soon as I need to, but it does make a difference in the shop. I hope this helps you some!"
