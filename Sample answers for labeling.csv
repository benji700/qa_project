6,Dismissed by my psychiatrist of 3 years for what I think is a BS reason and I'm not sure if I should say or do something... just lost and need advice (long but please read bc this is causing my anxiety to spike and I'd like reassurance),"Fired by my psychiatrist but is this a valid reason? (Long post but I desperately need advice!!)

I have been seeing this psychiatrist (well, actually his PA for the past 2 years) and was suddenly dismissed 2 weeks ago. 

I got a letter from them in the mail stating:
""Due to the complexity of your case in treatment, we will no longer be able to continue your treatment here at...”

Is this a valid reason for dismissal? 

I suffer from drug-resistant depression (it was diagnosed after seeing a previous psychiatrist for 8 years, but unfortunately she closed her practice), bipolar 2, borderline personality disorder, and severe anxiety. I also have fibromyalgia (which is commonly associated with mental illness) and arthritis, for which I take Tramadol.

They complained about me ""complaining and bad mouthing them” back in December and the only person to whom I complain was their office manager. Then they said that I was ""non-compliant” because I didn't have bloodwork done on ONE occasion, partly because of my severe anxiety about going out when the lockdown began and also because I was very ill for a week... so they told me after 2 weeks of not having my lithium levels tested, after having gone every other time I was asked and taking a drug test before every appointment, that I was non-compliant. Well, after I was well, I called their office and told them that I assumed I had a refill on my lithium from my last appointment, but didn't, and was out so I had no way to have my levels tested. The rather argumentative receptionist told me that my PA wasn't going to call in a refill because she wasn't sure if I needed my dosage adjusted (the same dose I have been on for 2 years). Also, from our previous appointment, I was under the impression that she was going to take me off lithium in order to try my on another drug I had taken a year prior but that my insurance stopped covering, but I found out that I qualified for free medication and so we were going to try me on that as the lithium has frankly never worked. 

So, I've been without any lithium for 2 weeks. And it has been rough. I had one day last week where I was very suicidal but didn't feel as though I could call them to get me into a local hospital here because of my dismissal but also because back in February, the PA commented about how I had been ""too” suicidal as of late..: but not in an effort to help me with the problem, but more of as a threat or some sort of warning which I took as, if I continued to have any suicidal episodes, they would dismiss me. It was also during this session that she said my case was ""too complicated.”

I feel as though they are punishing me for my mental illness... and is that even fair for a psychiatrist to do??

I am trying to find a new psychiatrist but it has been difficult as a lot of doctors in my area (we have a very high number of coronavirus cases) aren't accepting new patients until the situation improves. 

I have my final appointment over the phone in 2 hours. I am assuming that she will prescribe me 30 days worth of meds to last me until I'm able to find a new psychiatrist and will last me until I can see them (as you know, new patient appts are always a longer wait than appts for existing patients).

Do I have any legal recourse here? I'm not looking to sue, I would just like to report them to the state medical board. I feel entirely mistreated, because of how they holding my mental illnesses against me and how they apparently aren't skilled enough to handle my case while none of the doctors I've seen over the past 15 years (I relocated once, and have had several doctors close their practices, and was poorly mistreated by another (he wanted to take me off my Ativan immediately, no tapering despite a long history of taking a rather low dose of benzos, and put me on Vistaril, which has never worked despite my trying it on numerous occasions!), but I've never been dismissed. 

I apologize for the long post but I just feel wronged and don't know what I should do.",does your school have student counselor you can make an appointment there must be some student service you can turn to for help since youre studying economics and law public speaking will likely be an important part of your future jobif you cannot get enough assistance from school definitely look for professional help its already a great step to acknowledge your issues and talk it out but do check with your school first and use the service since its likely included in your tuitionid say you have a good evaluation of your current status and it seems you still have it under control even though you feel like youre about to lose it so definitely consult with someone and dont let the anxiety consume you more all the worries and burdens youve been carrying its not your fault and you should be proud that youve been handling it by yourself so far its time to let it out and get helpalso feel free to chat or vent here and let us know your progress
60,I keep deleting every single comment I make on a post,I don't know why I keep doing this but a few minutes ago I was trying to give someone advice but got stuck for 3 minutes trying to see if everything I wrote was perfect and had no mistakes. I really want to comment on posts without having to delete the comment 5000 times.,hello i would like to set an appt are you accepting new patients they will ask for name birthdate address and insurance card they will probably send you a few forms through email if this is a zoomonline appt if not you will either be mailed those forms or fill them out in the office when you arrive being honest up front can help also hi there im a bit anxious about setting an appointment but i would like help to do so
65,For those who have gotten therapy...,"I am thinking about getting therapy because I have been having random panic attacks out of nowhere and it feels like they are ruining my life.  They are so bad that I throw up, sweat like crazy, and just feel like I'm dying.  I need them to stop, but I don't know if therapy will help or not? If anyone has ever been to therapy for something similar, did it actually help?",your employer may also have an employee assistance program that provides therapy this year i started with cognitive processing therapy cpt after trying talk therapy cognitive behavioral therapy cbt with the cpt theres a set sessions which i was highly skeptical of with tools you work through and have long past it npr i think did a episode on cpt where she did a session a day to get through the days for me it worked combined with assistance with medication and has helped me work through quite a lot that the other types that didnt for meyou can also reach out to a local medical school and see if they have a department of psychiatry that may offer outpatient adult services most have switched to telemedicine so you dont have to be in person for them
4,I can't sleep because I'm scared of being schizophrenic. How do I stop these thoughts?,"Let me start off by saying I have never had any hallucinations or voices in my head.

My dad's dad was apparently schizophrenic and I wish they never told me. My cousin (grandchild of my dad's grandma's sister) on my dad's side is also schizophrenic, she seemed normal to me when I was younger and I looked up to her. Now she's not functioning normally and I'm scared.

I have used drugs before but not for years, but I do smoke once in a blue moon. I suffer from really bad anxiety. I've been lacking motivation in school and stuff in general.

It's 5:30 in the morning and I can't sleep because I'm 22 years old and it comes in the late twenties for females. I am so scared, how do I stop worrying about this? I really want to sleep now but I also know even when I do sleep that I will still be thinking about this.

Someone please help me. :(",if you think you would benefit from a counsellor or psychiatrist then i certainly encourage you to check those resources out whether thats in person or remotely beyond that ive been having a lot of night time anxiety as well where it feels like i cant shut my brain off and my body just wants to move and jiggle ive been taking melatonin which is just an over the counter sleep aid it doesnt work super well for me but others swear by it have you been exercising i find when i get a good workout in my brain respons really well to that and i often sleep a bit better that night then theres always meditation and journalling your thoughts those are great tools as well im not sure what youre already doing to deal with anxiety and nervousness so i dont exactly know what to suggest your you maybe if part of the anxiety is your thoughts going too fast for you to be able to control try to write them all down itll force you to slow down just a bit and maybe reflect on them
23,Morning Anxiety,Good morning everyone. I've been battling with anxiety for about a year now. It's progressively gotten worse and now I hate waking up because my anxiety is at an all time high in the mornings... any suggestions??,have you tried zofran its a prescription medication often given to cancer patients doing chemoradiation my general doctor just a regular ol health doctor prescribes it to me and it helps immensely with the nausea i get from anxiety
17,Is there any way to stop an anxiety attack almost instantly?,"I don't want to live this way, it's getting worse :(",honestly the best thing you can do is accept it and feel it pass over you out of curiosity what recently changed in your life
26,I always feel like I'm going to die,"Hey everyone, I wasn't sure where to go but I need to vent or get some advice. I have had depression and chronic anxiety since I was about the age of 11. I've managed to keep it under control for a good portion of my life but recently I feel like I've lost control of everything. My father called me last week, telling me he wanted to end his own life and I also found out my best friend from high school passed away which I think may have triggered it. 
I've started having severe panic attacks to where I physically feel like I'm dying, my chest gets heavy, I start to tingle or go numb, can't catch my breath and I'm already asthmatic (and I hyper focus on this). Im definitely over using my rescue inhaler. I'm so worried something is actually wrong with me. All I do is cry. I feel Ike I'm turning into a hypochondriac. When this happen I feel completely disconnected and out of touch. 
I saw my PCP on Thursday last week and changed my meds from Prozac to Wellbutrin, Ativan and Symbicort. The Ativan helps a lot when they happen, but it's not something I want to be dependent on. She wants to do some labs in a few weeks and do some blood work to check my thyroid which could be a huge contributing factor if that's the case. 
I don't even want to leave my house some days because I'm afraid it's going to happen out in public, I have to force myself to go do things. I don't think my friends and family know the severity of it. I feel so lost and alone. 
I feel like this has come out of no where and I don't know how to stop it.",remind yourself that teeth go a lot further down than what you can see you could look up xrays of teethjaws to reassure your brain that your teeth are very much attached even if they feel squishy right now also if youre new in the braces process it may help to know that in my experience at least its a very cyclical feeling you get a new wire and your gums feel squishy and painful for a bit but then your mouth starts to feel normal again by the time you go for your next appointment it always goes back to normal
13,Working out/Exercising despite anxiety,"A majority of my anxiety comes from health stuff, like I'll get a heart palpitation randomly and think I'm gonna have a heart attack, or feel tired and think I'm gonna just pass out. I want to exercise and start working out, but I know, or think perhaps, that the increased heart rate will cause me to be anxious. Anyone have any tips on dealing with this? I've been to a doctor and have a clean bill of health recently so I know it's all in my head.",f google a couple weeks ago i thought i had having a blood clot in my leg and then i was worried about it getting worse in reality it was just my anxiety making a part of leg hurt had a huge anxiety attack all the pain went away currently have a super tight chest most likely from anxiety but worried its my heart therefore causing a circle of anxiety i really need to quit googling things about my health
47,My parents go through my phone while I sleep,"Hey guys, I'm not sure if this is okay for me to post because I've never really been here beefore but what's going on has made me extremely anxious and I'm staying up until 4am because I'm petrified to sleep and I'm hoping someone might have some answers for me


So basically my door has a lock on it but my parents have a key too it, they've always been high preaching people with privacy and never lying to me and for the past year I've been telling them how I think someone has been accessing my phone throughout the night while I slept but they basically just called me crazy, for a long time I thought that it was a stranger but now, even with no evidence I believe it's my parents, recently they went through my brothers wallet looking for condoms (he's 18) while he wasn't around and made me swear not to tell him, obviously I lost trust iny parents from that day on but my friend agreed with me, she also wouldn't put it past my parents to do this, as I'm only 17 I know I can't do anything legally but the weird noises and random stuff on my phone stopped for a few months but around a month ago they started again, just after I got my P plates and became more individual about my life, two nights ago I fell asleep at around 4am and woke up at 2pm ish, when I turned on my phone it opened straight to a covid 19 website which I hadn't searched in well over a month, this shows that I'm not crazy, someone has been going on my phone while I sleep and the only people with motive are my over protective helicopter parents, I've since taken my finger print ID off so that they need my password, any ideas on what else I could do? I really want to get back to falling asleep and feeling safe in my own house. The only thing that has me baffled is why they would search up the covid website unless they were going through my history and accidentally clicked it? They're not tech savvy in the slightest but they're not dumb enough to leave a website open for me to find",i would suggest finding other methods of relaxing yourself that dont involve your phone yoga and stretching listening to music breathing exercises taking a showerbath etc etc itll be different for everyone it might also help to put your phone somewhere where you cant use it in bed like plugging it in across the room thatll help you wake up easier too haha
57,I am very stressed out due to my university entrance exam and I had a huge miscomm with my girlfriend.,"Due to the coronavirus breakout, everything is messed up around the world. During this period, my university entrance exam changed a lot and I have high hopes and dreams. I have a girlfriend that I love and we had a huge fight yesterday. Before this, I already felt like a failure and sometimes had suicidal thoughts. After this fight, I feel very depressed and also anxious about everything. I can feel that my mental health is getting worst everyday. I am trying to control it but last incident broke me. I really dont know what to do.",from experience if everything is running smoothly that she is reassuring you often and that there is no problems in the relationship then you are good a relationship is all about trust mainly when it comes to long distance relationship if you trust her then dont worry and dont overthink too much
18,To give my dog the walks that he deserves,"I have recently stopped walking my dog around because of the stress I get from saying good morning to people. (I usually go at the ass crack of dawn because there's only 3 people I need to ""interact with"" rather than like 7 I guess)

My predicament:

I walk and then a stranger says good morning. Sometimes if I'm too scared, I'll just look down at the ground before they even come close to me to avoid talking.

Result: I feel horrible, they probably feel horrible 

 If I look up, and they try to make eye contact, I panic. They say the good 'ol ""morning!"". I don't respond because I'm busy panicking and I react too slow.

Result: I think that they hate me and I hate myself for it

I tried to make the first move a few times and I say good morning like a brave little girl. It fizzles out like a flat soda and I mumble. 

Result: I say ""gmurnen"" and only mosquitoes can actually hear me

Am I missing a clear compromise here or do I have to keep powering through staring at the ground or those stupid ""gmurnen""s?

&gt; I actually haven't been diagnosed officially, but I stress about these social interactions so much to the point where I just assume I have it.",hi william im so sorry you feel that wayi totally understand the feeling of other people always seeming to judge and make assumptions but it really happens way less than we think usually people are too focussed on themselves to judge others so much i cross the street to avoid people all the time because im awkward and definitely dont want to make anyone feel shady if i am feeling a little intimidated by someone i feel a lot better if i see them smile i know its tough but hang in there and remember people arent judging and criticizing you nearly as much as you think and if you do see someone and make eye contact just give them a smile maybe theyll smile back
21,How do I keep a conversation going with someone I don't know that well?,"I've been isolated for a while. I'm REALLY good at first impression conversation #1. But my social anxiety kicks in when attempting to build relationships. I start to second guess everything i do/say. And this anxiety becomes a feedback loop of worries, so I psych myself out and can't think of things to say, lose the ability to be casual and I believe (could just be in my head) my convo with others feels awkward and forced.

For example, I met a women. She's a best friend of my coworker. I been trying to text her and see what's up. But I suck sooo bad at conversing that I feel like the convo goes nowhere and very quickly it turns into small talk and dies out. Basically there's no progression, because I sick bad at ""spitting game” or whatever you want to call it. This is a man/women context, but same stuff happens with most of my relationships in life.

Any suggestions on how to figure this stuff out? Am I alone in this or do you all have the Same issues with socialization?",no youre not crazysometimes talking to someone you feel comfortable with makes things all the better looking forward into the future is scary and hard so take every day as it comes and as hard as it is be optimistic ill be around if you need to talkrant and as i said earlier the most important thing is for you to release your feelings you have bottled up insidei hope for you all the best
15,How do I stop crying every time I do something slightly wrong?,"I am soooo tired of this. 
Like as soon as I make a small mistake I just can't stop crying even though I know its okay. Like I don't feel sad but I still cry a lot and cannot stop it!
The crying just makes me more anxious D:
Today I made a small error at work, fixed quickly and nothing bad came out of it but still I cried so much!!
Like it's so ridiculous but I don't know how to stop it.

Any advice? :(",i do it too im its been a problem for a few years now it makes it hard to live my life when im constantly worried how fast life is going and my teen years are already ending and ill be and then more years im im honestly not sure how to stop this from happening just try to live in the moment i guess but its pretty hard to live in the moment when you are thinking about living in the moment if that makes any sense just know you arent alone im pretty sure its normal
72,Struggling with how to quit lip picking,"Hi everyone,

I am 28 and I have suffered from anxiety as long as I can remember. I have had a lot of nasty habits over the years but the hardest one for me to kick is my lip picking. I'm going to go into some detail here but if it's TLDR any advice you have would be great! Thanks in advance.

I have clear memories of being around 5 years old and picking the skin from my lips in the bathroom mirror until they bled, but I honestly can't remember why I was doing it besides
perhaps, curiosity? 

As an adult I now mostly pick them subconsciously, especially while reading or scrolling social media. Sometimes I feel like I do it on purpose to help me concentrate, or clear my head. There are times when I only realize I'm doing it once it starts to hurt or I'm bleeding. On occasion I will pick them pretty raw and they are sore for days.

 If my lip gets a crack in it, you can forget it. I have one I have been struggling to let heal for about a month now. I just can't stand the dry skin or the bumps the scabs cause and I pick them off so my lips are ""smooth"" again. Most of the time I layer on some medicated chapstick before I go to sleep and pray it's healed when I wake up. 

My husband tries to help stop me when he notices it's happening and makes me aware or holds my hand, but the urge comes back almost within the minute. Sometimes I purposefully wait until he has left the room to go to town and then I hate myself afterwards. 

Sometimes I feel like I enjoy the pain? Or just the satisfaction I get from it and the pain is just a bonus? In the moment it might be great but the following hours/days of healing suck. I hate this habit and I hate how it makes me feel.

Please help me quit. I've tried so many times.",this is super rude pls post this on glassdoor also i watch career tiktoks and self made millenial on youtube who has rly great content im apply for traineeships tho so interview process might be more chill good luck tho
50,Heartbeat,"If you have anxiety, you probably well aware how hard it is to stay concrete and act like a normal human being with your heart thumping twice as faster around people.

I however, dont have this problem with my friends. But more to my family, since they constantly judge me unexpectedly. And so, during this quarantine, im having a hardtime eating meals with them.

Because my heart beat way too fast, Im sweating (thankfully my face never sweat much, so theyre unaware, but I had to wear baggy clothes to hide my body), my face twitch occasionally because damn its hard not to bend over and breathe raggedly cuz I feel like im running marathon. My stomach is not helping either.

How do I control my heartbeat so it beat normally when Im nervous?",its really good that youre talking more with close friends as this can really help i do think you might want to talk to a professional as this stems from when you were younger of course you should only do this if youre comfortable with it just to note this im not a professional myself so i cant say anything for sure thats why it might be a good idea to talk to someone who is much strength to you
39,gag reflex anxiety symptoms,"Hi everyone, 

Last year and now (it stopped for about 6 months) I've experienced an intense gag reflex when I eat and just overall feeling gittery/ empty feeling because I hardly eat as much as before. I'm pretty sure it's linked to my anxiety but I'm wondering if anyone has a similar experience. Just wanna make sure I'm not dying lol. 

An example is I wake up and will throw up my breakfast if I eat it because my stomach is straight turning about whats coming that day. Or I puke before an exam and can't eat the day of.",hey i totally feel this i used to have the exact same problem for me it was every time i had work the next morning i would wake up in the middle of the night before it and throw up and be up for a couple hours ive always had some physical symptoms but nothing that severe sorry to tell you that the only thing that seemed to help after dozens of dr appointments was changing jobs easier said than done thats for sure are you in a stressful line of work
40,Unable to control my hands?,"So this happened to me a few hours ago and I don't really know what to think of it.

So, today I was stressed the entire day, but I was utilizing healthy coping mechanisms to keep my anxiety under control (mostly breathing exercises, grounding techniques and using fidgets when I was having problems focusing on work). 

I had everything under control until I went into my room after dinner. My right hand started to wave at my right side, almost like I was ruffling the hair of a small child. I couldn't understand why it was happening or control my hand, and then my left hand started waving. 

The waving got more violent. I wanted to stop so I managed to clench my fists together, but then it was like I was stuck. I clenched my fists together and my nails dug into the palms of my hands. I was stuck like this for maybe 45 seconds... then it just stopped. 

Afterwords I was completely discombobulated and exhausted. It was a terrifying experience that I've never been through before... has this happened to anyone else? Any insights or advice for situations like this would be extremely helpful. Thank you

More information: I have GAD and depression, and I am not currently taking medication.",i also wanted to add that the only thing that has helped me over the years with this is doing positive things for my health that make me feel awesome and make me think wow if im eating all organic and running there is no way i have cancer like yoga badass nutrition walking moving running
16,"If someone doesn't reciprocate convo often enough, do they not wanna be friends?","Trying to figure out if people wanna be friends (or more with women). I don't if there are any rules, or at what point I should take people's actions meaning they're not interested.

I'm wondering: if it feels like I initiate the text convos more often, does it mean they're not interested?",well first of all its not silly you cant judge anyone for something like that its a fear and its valid being open and honest about how you feel with your family members is key honest communication is a life saver if they love you they will try to understand thats if you communicate assertively assertively communication means a person stands up for their own wants and needs while also taking into consideration the needs and wants of others without behaving passively or aggressively assertive communication is helping me tremendously with finding out what my wants and needs are
56,Having chest pains and am EXTREMELY worried.,"So I'm having some chest pains, and admittedly have been very anxious and my small dosage of Xanax has been out the last few days and I'm (still) waiting for my pharmacy. 

I worry about everything now especially because of Covid. Anytbing I touch, any cough I have, I live with my parents, I am FUCKING STRESSED. I haven't slept much these last 2 days as well because my mind will not shut off. 

Add in, I'm a very heavy, if not extreme, weed smoker. I know smoking causes heart problems, and I've lost lots of weight in the last 6-8 months from not eating a crazy amount and I do not exercise. 

I'm really anxious because I'm worried a heart attack is inevitable, but I also know anxiety can naturally cause chest pains. If I take a deep breathe in now, I don't feel anytbing in my chest. Every once in awhile though, towards the middle/top of my chest, I feel a bit of a pain or like something feels stuck or tensioned. It's not a 24/7 bothersome physically, but mentally it's freaking me out. I'm also worried it's the star of a viral infection, which of course could mean Covid. 

So, I'm not sure what to do. If anyone could please please please help or give me some guidance and comfort, I need it. I'm not sure what to think any more in all honesty, so that adds to my level of paranoia.",yep i get those all the time i go to the er they do an ekg and all the other heart tests and it always comes back as chest wall pain which is caused by anxiety ive seriously been to the er times in months from that
19,Fake friends????,"Do you think you're re always the one putting in efforts, always the one being walked over and pushed around and no one really cares about what you want/think/feel but they do something slightly nice for you once in a while and you think you OWE your friendship to them? 
And they just keep using you, manipulating you! And in the end I keep feeling bad because I wish I was more important or even a little important in someone's life. 
It's so frustrating to see how people hung out with you because their other friends weren't around or you were the only last option left. 
It's really bothering me can someone tell me what I should do. This feeling is so hurtful and it just comes randomly and I just don't want to feel like trash all the time.",ive always struggled with understanding how my friends see me i think another kicker for me was that a lot of life is wanting to feel understood and accepted but with social anxiety especially when youre trying your best to hide symptoms of it can go under our loved ones radars leaving us feeling like impostors i have a hard time with believing people get what i feel even when i tell them about it and ive kinda realized because i have friends who have their own disorders that they deal with everyday that its ok for me to struggle and have off days and interactions with them because they have flaws too we all deserve the space we occupy and you deserve to have social engagement just like everyone else your friends wouldnt take the time to meet up with you if they didnt think you where worth it and anyone who wouldnt want to spend time just because you have social anxiety would be a shitty friend
