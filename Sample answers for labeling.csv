1,How to feel wanted in a group?,"Apologies for the wall of text

So, I've been going to college for a year now, my major is pretty small so I know everybody in it.

I was texting a guy from my school yesterday, and he ended up adding me to a Facebook group that had all the guys in the major but me in it. The group was made a couple of months ago. 

I don't know how to feel. It's like, these dudes have all been hanging out and doing activities together for a couple of months and I don't know why I was excluded.

Now that I'm in the group I feel uncomfortable like I'm not really wanted there, like I was only added because this one dude liked me and the rest of them don't really. 

And then it's like, they're all getting together on Saturday, and now that I'm in the group I'm invited. But I feel like I shouldn't go because of covid and my history of lung problems, and at the same time I feel like if I don't go then I'll be even more excluded from the group. 

I just don't know how to feel like they like me. I want to make friends, but somehow being added to the group has made me feel even more excluded. It's a paradox. I'm so anxious about saying too much and making things uncomfortable, or saying too little and being weird, and knowing if I should hang out with them or not. I'd just really appreciate any advice. 

TLDR, got added to a group of other guys, but since I got added so late I feel excluded and awkward.",your over thinking stop caring what others thinkat the end of the day everyone is going to end up ft under ground why care what others think or be scared that your awkward i learned to stop caring about others and my life is better once u stop caring about others and their opinions youll be able to do anything
2,How do you find a stable partner?,"I look at r/Divorce sub and there are so many people contemplating divorce or divorcing everyday. Is it even possible to find a stable partner anymore? What is causing people to get married with the right one and then, all of a sudden, they are divorcing with kids sometimes? 

How do you find a stable partnership? I have had a lot of relationships but men were really unstable. I am more of a stable person. I want to stop attracting unstable partners. I'm just not sure where to start. I only work in a small office and everyone is in a stable marriage lol 

Thank you for your help! 😊",i understand what youre saying when i get really really anxious my brain feels like its closing almost does that even make any sense im not sure if its exactly what youre experiencing i will get overwhelmed with just this feeling of worry sometimes not about anything specific and my brain just feels like its locked in

4,I can't sleep because I'm scared of being schizophrenic. How do I stop these thoughts?,"Let me start off by saying I have never had any hallucinations or voices in my head.

My dad's dad was apparently schizophrenic and I wish they never told me. My cousin (grandchild of my dad's grandma's sister) on my dad's side is also schizophrenic, she seemed normal to me when I was younger and I looked up to her. Now she's not functioning normally and I'm scared.

I have used drugs before but not for years, but I do smoke once in a blue moon. I suffer from really bad anxiety. I've been lacking motivation in school and stuff in general.

It's 5:30 in the morning and I can't sleep because I'm 22 years old and it comes in the late twenties for females. I am so scared, how do I stop worrying about this? I really want to sleep now but I also know even when I do sleep that I will still be thinking about this.

Someone please help me. :(",if you think you would benefit from a counsellor or psychiatrist then i certainly encourage you to check those resources out whether thats in person or remotely beyond that ive been having a lot of night time anxiety as well where it feels like i cant shut my brain off and my body just wants to move and jiggle ive been taking melatonin which is just an over the counter sleep aid it doesnt work super well for me but others swear by it have you been exercising i find when i get a good workout in my brain respons really well to that and i often sleep a bit better that night then theres always meditation and journalling your thoughts those are great tools as well im not sure what youre already doing to deal with anxiety and nervousness so i dont exactly know what to suggest your you maybe if part of the anxiety is your thoughts going too fast for you to be able to control try to write them all down itll force you to slow down just a bit and maybe reflect on them
5,always afraid of sending my picture online,"so i'm always afraid of sending my picture to people i meet online and there are a lot of times where i like the other person but the anxiety of them not gonna like how i look draws me back and they leave. even in the rare cases where i send my picture, i ends up to be not their type (which basically their kind way of saying you're ugly) and that what makes me think twice before sending it. now i'm in the same situation, the other person is asking for my picture and i really like him but i'm just so afraid of what they're gonna think of me! any advice?

p.s. i don't really think i'm ugly",i think you just have to accept that it isnt your fault this shit was in the movie to begin withif youre seeking out these films for that purpose then id go see a therapist or something and express your concerns because you havent broken any laws but the thoughts are causing you distress and its clear you understand the eventual consequences of such thoughts but simply having access to a film that has children being children in it isnt necessarily a crime
6,Dismissed by my psychiatrist of 3 years for what I think is a BS reason and I'm not sure if I should say or do something... just lost and need advice (long but please read bc this is causing my anxiety to spike and I'd like reassurance),"Fired by my psychiatrist but is this a valid reason? (Long post but I desperately need advice!!)

I have been seeing this psychiatrist (well, actually his PA for the past 2 years) and was suddenly dismissed 2 weeks ago. 

I got a letter from them in the mail stating:
""Due to the complexity of your case in treatment, we will no longer be able to continue your treatment here at...”

Is this a valid reason for dismissal? 

I suffer from drug-resistant depression (it was diagnosed after seeing a previous psychiatrist for 8 years, but unfortunately she closed her practice), bipolar 2, borderline personality disorder, and severe anxiety. I also have fibromyalgia (which is commonly associated with mental illness) and arthritis, for which I take Tramadol.

They complained about me ""complaining and bad mouthing them” back in December and the only person to whom I complain was their office manager. Then they said that I was ""non-compliant” because I didn't have bloodwork done on ONE occasion, partly because of my severe anxiety about going out when the lockdown began and also because I was very ill for a week... so they told me after 2 weeks of not having my lithium levels tested, after having gone every other time I was asked and taking a drug test before every appointment, that I was non-compliant. Well, after I was well, I called their office and told them that I assumed I had a refill on my lithium from my last appointment, but didn't, and was out so I had no way to have my levels tested. The rather argumentative receptionist told me that my PA wasn't going to call in a refill because she wasn't sure if I needed my dosage adjusted (the same dose I have been on for 2 years). Also, from our previous appointment, I was under the impression that she was going to take me off lithium in order to try my on another drug I had taken a year prior but that my insurance stopped covering, but I found out that I qualified for free medication and so we were going to try me on that as the lithium has frankly never worked. 

So, I've been without any lithium for 2 weeks. And it has been rough. I had one day last week where I was very suicidal but didn't feel as though I could call them to get me into a local hospital here because of my dismissal but also because back in February, the PA commented about how I had been ""too” suicidal as of late..: but not in an effort to help me with the problem, but more of as a threat or some sort of warning which I took as, if I continued to have any suicidal episodes, they would dismiss me. It was also during this session that she said my case was ""too complicated.”

I feel as though they are punishing me for my mental illness... and is that even fair for a psychiatrist to do??

I am trying to find a new psychiatrist but it has been difficult as a lot of doctors in my area (we have a very high number of coronavirus cases) aren't accepting new patients until the situation improves. 

I have my final appointment over the phone in 2 hours. I am assuming that she will prescribe me 30 days worth of meds to last me until I'm able to find a new psychiatrist and will last me until I can see them (as you know, new patient appts are always a longer wait than appts for existing patients).

Do I have any legal recourse here? I'm not looking to sue, I would just like to report them to the state medical board. I feel entirely mistreated, because of how they holding my mental illnesses against me and how they apparently aren't skilled enough to handle my case while none of the doctors I've seen over the past 15 years (I relocated once, and have had several doctors close their practices, and was poorly mistreated by another (he wanted to take me off my Ativan immediately, no tapering despite a long history of taking a rather low dose of benzos, and put me on Vistaril, which has never worked despite my trying it on numerous occasions!), but I've never been dismissed. 

I apologize for the long post but I just feel wronged and don't know what I should do.",does your school have student counselor you can make an appointment there must be some student service you can turn to for help since youre studying economics and law public speaking will likely be an important part of your future jobif you cannot get enough assistance from school definitely look for professional help its already a great step to acknowledge your issues and talk it out but do check with your school first and use the service since its likely included in your tuitionid say you have a good evaluation of your current status and it seems you still have it under control even though you feel like youre about to lose it so definitely consult with someone and dont let the anxiety consume you more all the worries and burdens youve been carrying its not your fault and you should be proud that youve been handling it by yourself so far its time to let it out and get helpalso feel free to chat or vent here and let us know your progress
7,I'm sick of anxiety.,I'm sick of feeling scared. I'm sick of my chest feeling tight for no reason. I'm sick of my head feeling weird and tight whenever I think about it. I want to be free. I want to feel happy again. I'm sick of feeling like I'm gonna die. I'm sick of thinking I'll get a heart attack. I'm sick of all of that. I need help. I want my happiness again.,yes i am like this and quite sure i have hypochondria i stopped googling bc i used to be so obsessive about it id go to er often but i still have anxiety about things like this its all in our head but it feels reality hard to believe id be healthy
8,"I am not suicidal, but I have such a sudden strong fear of death that I really need someone to talk to","Is calling the suicide hotline good for this situation? I called my local mental health clinic in my state but no ones there so I left a message(lockdown I assume). I don't know what number to call to actually get to somebody or set up an appointment somewhere(no insurance though) when my problem is the complete opposite of suicide.

I googled and its called death anxiety. Thing is I'm not sick(medically speaking like a terminal disease), I'm not 'surrounded' by death like sick family members or in the army. I've tried talking to myself that my death isn't going to come until I'm an old man(Im only 27) but it only slightly helped.

I want to say this started about a month ago, and it was really bad the first week. Since then there would be small moments where I would get kinda anxious, a little scared but not much. Then last night at like 3-4am I just started having such bad anxiety and fear that I think I had my first panic attack. I don't know how I slept but waking up I felt fine for a teeny bit before the anxiety came back, its not as bad as yesterday but I'm back to seeking help actively. Should I've made the thread in the mental health subreddit too? It's just this has gotten so bad so quickly but I haven't been diagnosed with anything as I've no money for a doctor and most aren't seeing patients cause of the lockdown. I thought about calling the suicide hotline but my problem is the polar opposite of what that lines for. I've come close to crying a few times but nothing yet, if you would've told me I'd be like this even 3 months ago I would've slapped the shit out of you, I have no idea why this is happening.",just the fact that youre alive at all is such a infinitely crazy miracle that even if you died during birth sorry for the grim thought youd have won the lottery considering the millions of other cells fighting to be bornthink about the fact that throughout all of history every one of your ancestors had to meet have kids those kids had to survive and meet their spouses and have kids just to give you a chance to race out at the right time to fertilize an egg and be borneveryone will die no matter if they worry about it all day or if they live their life to the fullest but i have found solace in thinking about the crazy miracle that i even get to die in the first place
9,Physical torture due to Anxiety/Depression,Does anyone else feel physically sick like everyday and you know it's stemming from your anxiety/depression? I feel mentally drained and tired everyday and I get consistent headaches and nausea. It makes life quite unbearable. Does anyone have any tips on how to get rid of all these physical effects? Also I am on Zoloft 125mg and I'm starting to wonder if it's causing side effects. I tried slowly tapering off one time and it was the most miserable time of my life. Idk what to do. Any advice or tips welcomed.,oh wow cooking is so good for your mental good job getting into that but yeah keep it up learn the basics you will be great just it takes time maybe go on cooking classes but yeah try your best if now you only know how to fry an egg learn how to fry that egg to perfection but yeah pasta is kinda easy try that
10,Ok I'll try this again- anyone ever been on Abilify? Can you pls tell me a little more about it? What my pharmacist said was confusing.,"Hi, I was just prescribed abilify and I was wondering if anyone would have any information about this drug? 

The pharmacist said to me 'You may have some thoughts. Contact your doctor if you don't like them.' when I picked it up. Half of me was like 'uhhhhh..... Yeah I sure hope I do have thoughts???' and the other half of me wondered what he could have even possibly meant. Suicidal thoughts? Why would anyone like those? Is that not what he meant? So confused lol 

Anyone have a really good or bad experience with it? My anxiety is constantly off the charts, I'd really like to be able to physically relax and maybe sleep without taking 4 different drugs to help me sleep that aren't successful half of the time bc I'm so physically uptight. 

Thanks in advance.",im much younger than you and i have these symptoms goes on for days and sometimes weeks breathing and heart gets so bad if you have concerns call your doctor or schedule an appointment
11,Is there a way calming yourself mid panic attack?,I suffer from anxiety disorder and I get frequent panic attacks. This quarantine has made it worse for me cause everyone around me is busy and I'm so lonely. During the past few days I've been getting more anxious and been having regular panic attacks that are very uncomfortable and lead to me crying a lot. Whenever I feel it coming I try to breath and calm myself down but it just seems to get worse. Does anyone know a way to calm yourself when you feel it coming?,im sorry you are going through this i had a panic attack recently i feel like i get them when i see absolutely no solution to a problem youll get through this message me if you want im and have been living with gad my whole life

13,Working out/Exercising despite anxiety,"A majority of my anxiety comes from health stuff, like I'll get a heart palpitation randomly and think I'm gonna have a heart attack, or feel tired and think I'm gonna just pass out. I want to exercise and start working out, but I know, or think perhaps, that the increased heart rate will cause me to be anxious. Anyone have any tips on dealing with this? I've been to a doctor and have a clean bill of health recently so I know it's all in my head.",f google a couple weeks ago i thought i had having a blood clot in my leg and then i was worried about it getting worse in reality it was just my anxiety making a part of leg hurt had a huge anxiety attack all the pain went away currently have a super tight chest most likely from anxiety but worried its my heart therefore causing a circle of anxiety i really need to quit googling things about my health
14,Confusing,Whenever people come up to me and say hi or hey does this mean they want to talk to me or that there just saying hi. One of my friends told me that's how ppl start conversations. The only problem with this is that l I don't realize and whenever I do I just give 1 or two-word responses.,common sense filter off you can cook at unusual times i make my lunch at am if im gonna cook it at the dorms and make an early dinner you can also cook late at like pm or whatever if someone does come in its okay breathe keep doing your thing it will be a little awkward but in hindsight it doesnt really matter just please take care of yourself i know readymade meals might be expensive but eat something bread and cheese bananas whatever one meal a day is not enough i send hugs you can do it
15,How do I stop crying every time I do something slightly wrong?,"I am soooo tired of this. 
Like as soon as I make a small mistake I just can't stop crying even though I know its okay. Like I don't feel sad but I still cry a lot and cannot stop it!
The crying just makes me more anxious D:
Today I made a small error at work, fixed quickly and nothing bad came out of it but still I cried so much!!
Like it's so ridiculous but I don't know how to stop it.

Any advice? :(",i do it too im its been a problem for a few years now it makes it hard to live my life when im constantly worried how fast life is going and my teen years are already ending and ill be and then more years im im honestly not sure how to stop this from happening just try to live in the moment i guess but its pretty hard to live in the moment when you are thinking about living in the moment if that makes any sense just know you arent alone im pretty sure its normal
16,"If someone doesn't reciprocate convo often enough, do they not wanna be friends?","Trying to figure out if people wanna be friends (or more with women). I don't if there are any rules, or at what point I should take people's actions meaning they're not interested.

I'm wondering: if it feels like I initiate the text convos more often, does it mean they're not interested?",well first of all its not silly you cant judge anyone for something like that its a fear and its valid being open and honest about how you feel with your family members is key honest communication is a life saver if they love you they will try to understand thats if you communicate assertively assertively communication means a person stands up for their own wants and needs while also taking into consideration the needs and wants of others without behaving passively or aggressively assertive communication is helping me tremendously with finding out what my wants and needs are
17,Is there any way to stop an anxiety attack almost instantly?,"I don't want to live this way, it's getting worse :(",honestly the best thing you can do is accept it and feel it pass over you out of curiosity what recently changed in your life
18,To give my dog the walks that he deserves,"I have recently stopped walking my dog around because of the stress I get from saying good morning to people. (I usually go at the ass crack of dawn because there's only 3 people I need to ""interact with"" rather than like 7 I guess)

My predicament:

I walk and then a stranger says good morning. Sometimes if I'm too scared, I'll just look down at the ground before they even come close to me to avoid talking.

Result: I feel horrible, they probably feel horrible 

 If I look up, and they try to make eye contact, I panic. They say the good 'ol ""morning!"". I don't respond because I'm busy panicking and I react too slow.

Result: I think that they hate me and I hate myself for it

I tried to make the first move a few times and I say good morning like a brave little girl. It fizzles out like a flat soda and I mumble. 

Result: I say ""gmurnen"" and only mosquitoes can actually hear me

Am I missing a clear compromise here or do I have to keep powering through staring at the ground or those stupid ""gmurnen""s?

&gt; I actually haven't been diagnosed officially, but I stress about these social interactions so much to the point where I just assume I have it.",hi william im so sorry you feel that wayi totally understand the feeling of other people always seeming to judge and make assumptions but it really happens way less than we think usually people are too focussed on themselves to judge others so much i cross the street to avoid people all the time because im awkward and definitely dont want to make anyone feel shady if i am feeling a little intimidated by someone i feel a lot better if i see them smile i know its tough but hang in there and remember people arent judging and criticizing you nearly as much as you think and if you do see someone and make eye contact just give them a smile maybe theyll smile back
19,Fake friends????,"Do you think you're re always the one putting in efforts, always the one being walked over and pushed around and no one really cares about what you want/think/feel but they do something slightly nice for you once in a while and you think you OWE your friendship to them? 
And they just keep using you, manipulating you! And in the end I keep feeling bad because I wish I was more important or even a little important in someone's life. 
It's so frustrating to see how people hung out with you because their other friends weren't around or you were the only last option left. 
It's really bothering me can someone tell me what I should do.

21,How do I keep a conversation going with someone I don't know that well?,"I've been isolated for a while. I'm REALLY good at first impression conversation #1. But my social anxiety kicks in when attempting to build relationships. I start to second guess everything i do/say. And this anxiety becomes a feedback loop of worries, so I psych myself out and can't think of things to say, lose the ability to be casual and I believe (could just be in my head) my convo with others feels awkward and forced.

For example, I met a women. She's a best friend of my coworker. I been trying to text her and see what's up. But I suck sooo bad at conversing that I feel like the convo goes nowhere and very quickly it turns into small talk and dies out. Basically there's no progression, because I sick bad at ""spitting game” or whatever you want to call it. This is a man/women context, but same stuff happens with most of my relationships in life.

Any suggestions on how to figure this stuff out? Am I alone in this or do you all have the Same issues with socialization?",no youre not crazysometimes talking to someone you feel comfortable with makes things all the better looking forward into the future is scary and hard so take every day as it comes and as hard as it is be optimistic ill be around if you need to talkrant and as i said earlier the most important thing is for you to release your feelings you have bottled up insidei hope for you all the best

26,I always feel like I'm going to die,"Hey everyone, I wasn't sure where to go but I need to vent or get some advice. I have had depression and chronic anxiety since I was about the age of 11. I've managed to keep it under control for a good portion of my life but recently I feel like I've lost control of everything. My father called me last week, telling me he wanted to end his own life and I also found out my best friend from high school passed away which I think may have triggered it. 
I've started having severe panic attacks to where I physically feel like I'm dying, my chest gets heavy, I start to tingle or go numb, can't catch my breath and I'm already asthmatic (and I hyper focus on this). Im definitely over using my rescue inhaler. I'm so worried something is actually wrong with me. All I do is cry. I feel Ike I'm turning into a hypochondriac. When this happen I feel completely disconnected and out of touch. 
I saw my PCP on Thursday last week and changed my meds from Prozac to Wellbutrin, Ativan and Symbicort. The Ativan helps a lot when they happen, but it's not something I want to be dependent on. She wants to do some labs in a few weeks and do some blood work to check my thyroid which could be a huge contributing factor if that's the case. 
I don't even want to leave my house some days because I'm afraid it's going to happen out in public, I have to force myself to go do things. I don't think my friends and family know the severity of it. I feel so lost and alone. 
I feel like this has come out of no where and I don't know how to stop it.",remind yourself that teeth go a lot further down than what you can see you could look up xrays of teethjaws to reassure your brain that your teeth are very much attached even if they feel squishy right now also if youre new in the braces process it may help to know that in my experience at least its a very cyclical feeling you get a new wire and your gums feel squishy and painful for a bit but then your mouth starts to feel normal again by the time you go for your next appointment it always goes back to normal
27,How to feel wanted in a group?,"Apologies for the wall of text

So, I've been going to college for a year now, my major is pretty small so I know everybody in it.

I was texting a guy from my school yesterday, and he ended up adding me to a Facebook group that had all the guys in the major but me in it. The group was made a couple of months ago. 

I don't know how to feel. It's like, these dudes have all been hanging out and doing activities together for a couple of months and I don't know why I was excluded.

Now that I'm in the group I feel uncomfortable like I'm not really wanted there, like I was only added because this one dude liked me and the rest of them don't really. 

And then it's like, they're all getting together on Saturday, and now that I'm in the group I'm invited. But I feel like I shouldn't go because of covid and my history of lung problems, and at the same time I feel like if I don't go then I'll be even more excluded from the group. 

I just don't know how to feel like they like me. I want to make friends, but somehow being added to the group has made me feel even more excluded. It's a paradox. I'm so anxious about saying too much and making things uncomfortable, or saying too little and being weird, and knowing if I should hang out with them or not. I'd just really appreciate any advice. 

TLDR, got added to a group of other guys, but since I got added so late I feel excluded and awkward.",your over thinking stop caring what others thinkat the end of the day everyone is going to end up ft under ground why care what others think or be scared that your awkward i learned to stop caring about others and my life is better once u stop caring about others and their opinions youll be able to do anything
28,I just really need some help :(,So I started struggling with anxiety off and on since I was 14 (currently 21) and it's really come to a head which I'm in college and has been especially bad in 2020 for obvious reasons. Within the past 2 months it's gotten reallyyy bad I can't sleep without taking melatonin (often not going to bed until between 2-4 am) and the sleep I do get is often restful or deep sleep and it's deeply impairing my brain functioning. It's causing conflicts with my parents (who I live with) bc I'm so agitated bc how high my anxiety is which is furthering the anxiety. I also often feel like I'm being choked and can't breathe and I've been shaking really bad lately too. It's honestly been so bad I seriously thought about calling out work today. Before the pandemic I was going to the gym everyday and that was really the only thing helping me but now they've been closed for 2 months and my state is opening them back up on Monday but I don't feel safe going back just yet. I go to a therapist every other week and have avoided going to a psychiatrist and getting on medication bc I'm worried about the potential side effects but it's honestly effecting me in every facet of my life and I really just need some advice bc idk what else to do at this point 🙃,sounds like social anxiety to me mine first started when i was while walking through a mall when i randomly had my first panic attack from that day on it became worse and worse and here i am today years later still struggling i would highly suggest you try and do anything you can early on trust me ive never done a single thing about mine and i regret it so much its got to the point where my own friends and family give me so much anxiety that i can barely do anything around them i literally havent eaten a single thing at school in years and avoid eating when family is home im scared of every social interaction and scenario ever even the smallest things give me so much anxietymy biggest suggestion for you is that you speak to people about it and try and do anything you can to prevent it from becoming worse the earlier you do something about it the less chance you have for it becoming as bad as mine and many others if it does become worse and you cant get rid of it just know that you are not alone and there are many people who are willing to talk to you and help you out

31,Very anxious about graduating and finding a job due to past work trauma + lack of direction [also need hug and support😞],"I am currently doing a Bachelor of science, majoring in psychology, and I am about to graduate. My anxiety and over thinking has led me go question whether this was even the right path many tines, or whether I suit the work lifestyle we have now. I've caught myself overthinking multiple times over things I can't control (Why was I born in a society like this? Why am I like this? Why is the work life so demanding? Why can't I just live peacefully?), and it only frustrates me to the point where I cry myself to sleep. 

From this over thinking, I believe it all started when I worked at a cafe for 2 months, 3 years ago. It was my first job and the manager was really toxic - she would be question how I got into my degree (she assumed I academically dumb at first), yell at me when I wasn't fast enough (to be fair I find it really difficult to remember the proportions of ingredients for the drink because there was so many), and guilt trip me to quit. I felt like such a failure for not being able to work under pressure and remember things that other people could. Now I realise that the behaviour is toxic and not everyone is like that but it has really deepened my anxiety and depression, especially towards work. Since the cafe 3 years ago, I haven't worked since.

I guess another question I'd like to ask is how to deal with the feelings of anxiety and depression. Ive noticed that when Im stressed or frustrated, I have a very heavy feeling in my heart thats sometimes quite painful. like a tightening around the heart. I have tried exercising and sighing it out but it doesn't exactly help. I realised that this can last quite a while and is one of the causes to a spiral of anxious and depressive thoughts.

tl:dr I have anxiety and had work trauma and idk what to do now because I am about to graduate.",i had this problem once so i can only imagine how youre feeling right now is there any way you can visit your work sooner than your next shift i would say facing whatever consequence may come or not come would be the best course i know it can be difficult but trying to focus on a task youve been putting off or a chore that needs to be done if your mind is active with something else theres always the slight chance you could push out bits of anxiety talking to someone closetrustworthy for reassurance has a chance of helping getting outside input may reassure possible outcomes for you so theres less worry about what may happenlook at what is the best possible solution and try to prepare for the worst i know it can be nerveracking in itself to think about but it can also be calming to plan next steps in case of a worst case scenario situation ive seen posts that sour candies can help if you leave them on the tongue the sourness and grittiness can divert your mind ive never tried it but ive seen several things about this method cliche but physical activity possibly better if it were something like a guided workout that way you can focus on the instructions and then release endorphins as well or a run if you can do it in a safe area personallyive found physical contact and warm help calm me down laying down close to someone with their hand on me under a blanket soothes slightlyi always count now when im having an attack i will keep counting until my mind wanders if my mind wanders i restart and aim to get higher than my last count its helped calmed me down i really hope you find some kind of calm anxietys something i wish really didnt exist all the best to you and i hope everything can work out in your favor and get better from here
32,Triggered by my father. How do I deal with it?,"For as long as I can remember, I have been triggered by my father and his loudness (the loud noises he makes when he does things like closing the door loudly, the way he moves around the house, his voice, just basically the way he does things in the day to day). When he used to get mad in the past, when I was a child to teenager or so, he would make the same noises; for example someone getting really mad and just slamming doors, placing things on tables loudly, possibly throwing things around or so. It affected me back then and I thought it had gone away. But I think my body just recognizes this as a threat now. I've tried to deal with it myself but I feel like I just can't anymore. 

I think I used to be able to deal with it to an extent (I think by playing video games, LIKE A LOT of video games just to have something to focus on and calm my mind) but I just don't know how to anymore. I end up going to my room and just stay in there to try to avoid him and our family live in a small enough house to hear everything that's going on. He affects my mental health the most and I've just been trying to fight it so much that I don't want to anymore. Its exhausting. He has mental health issues that he absolutely just doesn't deal with. He doesn't want to blame himself for anything so he'll do whatever the fuck. Its serious but it's not something diagnosable like ADHD or something like that. I feel like the way he moves and makes all that noise is just him releasing energy in a stupid way if that makes sense.

My mother and I both got mad at him for doing that shit for so many years and this whole ordeal happened. During the few days after or maybe even a week, he changed a bit. Got quieter and calmer. He did get better a bit as a person but he's kind of back to his old ways to me. He's honestly just an anxious, unconfident, heady person and its leaking onto me whenever I get triggered by him. I always think and say to myself something along the lines of ""how do you not want to deal with your problems and become better and at peace with things?""

In my opinion it's just really bummy. To me, it seems like he's given up on life and has stopped trying to deal with his problems/get better in the most non-healthy way possible. When he does trigger me in this way, I start to get really into my head, I feel my self esteem drop, my energy levels drop, I become flustered, get mad easily, start to have a blank state of mind. I won't be able to focus on anything. Sometimes I'll just blindly do things. My mind gets to the point where I'm literally waiting for the next loud noise to come about. It's just a sudden shock when he does make a loud noise and that feeling where your startled just stays with me constantly if that makes sense. 

How else could I deal with this? I don't know how to calm myself down anymore and I can't function throughout my day when he's around most of the time. I can't focus on anything and all these stupid unrelated problems start arising from it. I've tried using techniques from meditation but they only help so much. I am considering going to a psychologist but I'm seeing if I can deal with it myself before going to one. Actually have also TRIED to talk to him about some things unrelated to try to give him an idea of what he's doing and how its affecting those around but it only worked so much. 

But honestly I'm considering just moving out now (I was already considering moving out cause I had just gotten a new job) because I need a peace of mind and I do not want to stress out and literally lose my hair over this because it's starting to thin. I appreciate anyone that offers advice and/or takes the time to read this. I can fill in more blanks if the story seems all over the place.

33,Fake friends????,"Do you think you're re always the one putting in efforts, always the one being walked over and pushed around and no one really cares about what you want/think/feel but they do something slightly nice for you once in a while and you think you OWE your friendship to them? 
And they just keep using you, manipulating you! And in the end I keep feeling bad because I wish I was more important or even a little important in someone's life. 
It's so frustrating to see how people hung out with you because their other friends weren't around or you were the only last option left. 
It's really bothering me can someone tell me what I should do. This feeling is so hurtful and it just comes randomly and I just don't want to feel like trash all the time.",ive always struggled with understanding how my friends see me i think another kicker for me was that a lot of life is wanting to feel understood and accepted but with social anxiety especially when youre trying your best to hide symptoms of it can go under our loved ones radars leaving us feeling like impostors i have a hard time with believing people get what i feel even when i tell them about it and ive kinda realized because i have friends who have their own disorders that they deal with everyday that its ok for me to struggle and have off days and interactions with them because they have flaws too we all deserve the space we occupy and you deserve to have social engagement just like everyone else your friends wouldnt take the time to meet up with you if they didnt think you where worth it and anyone who wouldnt want to spend time just because you have social anxiety would be a shitty friend

36,I Need Advice/Answers Please,"I have intrusive thoughts whenever I feel happy or in the moment. For example, when I start to laugh at something funny, I will overanalyze why I am laughing and then I won't be happy and laughing anymore. Another example is when I play soccer, I would be in the moment of the game, and then out of nowhere, I would have thoughts of like ""why am I here"", and overanalyze my play, instead of being in the moment.

How do I stay in the moment?

37,Nightmares of former friend,"I just want to preface this that I can't afford therapy at this moment because I moved home from college because of covid-19 and lost my job. I'm currently 25 years old. 

One year ago, I let a friend stay at my apartment for six weeks due to a divorce he was going through. During the time he stayed at my apartment, he almost got me kicked out for smoking weed when I told him not to. He was incredibly rude and would invite friends over without permission and would get easily offended over everything. 

I finally had enough when I asked him to keep the music down once when I was trying to get to bed. He started banging on my bedroom door and was screaming as loud as he could that he was going to kill me. I kicked him out the next day and he would send me really bizarre videos ranting about things with his shirt off.

Since then, I've blocked his phone number and all of his social media accounts and haven't heard from him since. I've had nightmares about him at least once a week for around six months. If I hear a weird noise at home (my apartment and my family's home both creak), I'm immediately in fear because I imagine him breaking into my house. If I hear that I'm getting a phone call or text message, I immediately get afraid that he's calling or sending me a weird message. He's moved to a different country, but I'm always in fear that I'll even see him. I even saw an American who vaguely looked like him on my trip to Japan and I went into panic mode.

It's even hard to go to sleep sometimes because I'm afraid of dreaming about him. Since back at home for now, my mom has been so helpful with talking to me about it, but it's still incredibly difficult. I dealt with anxiety most of my life and did an incredible job at dealing with it to the point where it felt that it would never come back. After having him at my house, it feels 5-10 times worse than it has ever been. I know I'll probably never see him again, but it feels like I'm going to lose my mind! 

What should I do? I really need help.",you might be harassing them without them knowing or else they may not like you very much i reckon just send one of them whats going on messages and leaving it until they reply most likely youre overreacting and its not even about you
38,Do I have anxiety,"Hi users of r/Anxiety I feel like I have social anxiety but I don't know if it's true or not. I'm too scared to ask my mom to go to a therapist so I'm asking the people of r/ Anxiety. I don't know how to explain it but here are some things I'm afraid of/ get anxious about: 

Groups of people (usually two or more) 
Being around more than one person. That probably doesn't make sense but I usually like to hang out with myself and one other person or people I trust or feel comfortable with but most of the time it's me and one other person because when I'm with a group nobody listens to me or I don't say anything at all because nobody pays attention (I'm a threes a crowd kinda person) 
Afraid of talking or going anywhere. Probably doesn't make sense either but I don't like to talk or go anywhere too much because I'm scared that I'll say or do something so stupid that nobody will let it go and I'll die of embarrassment (that's dramatic) but I'll have a full blown conversation with someone I'm comfortable with or someone that's willing to listen to me.. I can talk for hours with you if your the right person.

But anyway I just want some advice or suggestions about what I just talked about.. feel free to comment, some of your comments might me really helpful for me! That's all, thank you for your time 🌸",i struggle with dentist anxiety myself i usually close my eyes when they bring the needle out i have found bringing a friend you trust and that can provide support really helps someone who has been through the same procedure as you finally be kind to yourself there is noting wrong about dentistry anxiety sometimes pulling yourself out of a situation that is causing your anxiety is needed
39,gag reflex anxiety symptoms,"Hi everyone, 

Last year and now (it stopped for about 6 months) I've experienced an intense gag reflex when I eat and just overall feeling gittery/ empty feeling because I hardly eat as much as before. I'm pretty sure it's linked to my anxiety but I'm wondering if anyone has a similar experience. Just wanna make sure I'm not dying lol. 

An example is I wake up and will throw up my breakfast if I eat it because my stomach is straight turning about whats coming that day. Or I puke before an exam and can't eat the day of.",hey i totally feel this i used to have the exact same problem for me it was every time i had work the next morning i would wake up in the middle of the night before it and throw up and be up for a couple hours ive always had some physical symptoms but nothing that severe sorry to tell you that the only thing that seemed to help after dozens of dr appointments was changing jobs easier said than done thats for sure are you in a stressful line of work
40,Unable to control my hands?,"So this happened to me a few hours ago and I don't really know what to think of it.

So, today I was stressed the entire day, but I was utilizing healthy coping mechanisms to keep my anxiety under control (mostly breathing exercises, grounding techniques and using fidgets when I was having problems focusing on work). 

I had everything under control until I went into my room after dinner. My right hand started to wave at my right side, almost like I was ruffling the hair of a small child. I couldn't understand why it was happening or control my hand, and then my left hand started waving. 

The waving got more violent. I wanted to stop so I managed to clench my fists together, but then it was like I was stuck. I clenched my fists together and my nails dug into the palms of my hands. I was stuck like this for maybe 45 seconds... then it just stopped. 

Afterwords I was completely discombobulated and exhausted. It was a terrifying experience that I've never been through before... has this happened to anyone else? Any insights or advice for situations like this would be extremely helpful. Thank you

An example is I wake up and will throw up my breakfast if I eat it because my stomach is straight turning about whats coming that day. Or I puke before an exam and can't eat the day of.",hey i totally feel this i used to have the exact same problem for me it was every time i had work the next morning i would wake up in the middle of the night before it and throw up and be up for a couple hours ive always had some physical symptoms but nothing that severe sorry to tell you that the only thing that seemed to help after dozens of dr appointments was changing jobs easier said than done thats for sure are you in a stressful line of work
42,Anyone else feel like conversation is just a set of rules and ur always carefully following them and ur constantly trying to not be awkward or weird or talk too much about yourself?,"I dont know if its normal to be like this, sometimes I feel like maybe I have undiagnosed ADHD, but other times I think its just all the anxiety and depression from being a college drop out and being gay and trans.

43,How do you know when to quit,"So I typically deal with anxiety on a fairly consistent basis. Since covid however a lot of things that gave me anxiety haven't been an issue since isolation. Recently however I had to start back up again on a side job. This job causes me a lot of stress and anxiety but I push through it because I need money, and I don't want to stop doing things just because my anxiety is acting up. So my question is how do you know when to stop and let yourself rest? When should I push through the anxiety vs. stop and reset? Idk if that makes sense though",doesnt really matter the diagnosis its significantly disrupting your life go speak to a professional and yes this sounds a lot like social anxiety

47,My parents go through my phone while I sleep,"Hey guys, I'm not sure if this is okay for me to post because I've never really been here beefore but what's going on has made me extremely anxious and I'm staying up until 4am because I'm petrified to sleep and I'm hoping someone might have some answers for me


So basically my door has a lock on it but my parents have a key too it, they've always been high preaching people with privacy and never lying to me and for the past year I've been telling them how I think someone has been accessing my phone throughout the night while I slept but they basically just called me crazy, for a long time I thought that it was a stranger but now, even with no evidence I believe it's my parents, recently they went through my brothers wallet looking for condoms (he's 18) while he wasn't around and made me swear not to tell him, obviously I lost trust iny parents from that day on but my friend agreed with me, she also wouldn't put it past my parents to do this, as I'm only 17 I know I can't do anything legally but the weird noises and random stuff on my phone stopped for a few months but around a month ago they started again, just after I got my P plates and became more individual about my life, two nights ago I fell asleep at around 4am and woke up at 2pm ish, when I turned on my phone it opened straight to a covid 19 website which I hadn't searched in well over a month, this shows that I'm not crazy, someone has been going on my phone while I sleep and the only people with motive are my over protective helicopter parents, I've since taken my finger print ID off so that they need my password, any ideas on what else I could do? I really want to get back to falling asleep and feeling safe in my own house. The only thing that has me baffled is why they would search up the covid website unless they were going through my history and accidentally clicked it? They're not tech savvy in the slightest but they're not dumb enough to leave a website open for me to find",i would suggest finding other methods of relaxing yourself that dont involve your phone yoga and stretching listening to music breathing exercises taking a showerbath etc etc itll be different for everyone it might also help to put your phone somewhere where you cant use it in bed like plugging it in across the room thatll help you wake up easier too haha

50,Heartbeat,"If you have anxiety, you probably well aware how hard it is to stay concrete and act like a normal human being with your heart thumping twice as faster around people.

I however, dont have this problem with my friends. But more to my family, since they constantly judge me unexpectedly. And so, during this quarantine, im having a hardtime eating meals with them.

Because my heart beat way too fast, Im sweating (thankfully my face never sweat much, so theyre unaware, but I had to wear baggy clothes to hide my body), my face twitch occasionally because damn its hard not to bend over and breathe raggedly cuz I feel like im running marathon. My stomach is not helping either.

How do I control my heartbeat so it beat normally when Im nervous?",its really good that youre talking more with close friends as this can really help i do think you might want to talk to a professional as this stems from when you were younger of course you should only do this if youre comfortable with it just to note this im not a professional myself so i cant say anything for sure thats why it might be a good idea to talk to someone who is much strength to you
51,Is it a good idea to up my medication?,"I've been on 1MG of klonopin for years. It has helped, but I've fallen back into old habits of being agoraphobia and I can't leave the house without panicking. I have an appointment with my dr today and I feel like I may need my dose upped to help me temporarily help with exposure therapy? Does anyone have advice?",i was on meds for about years i got so fed up with depending on them because sometimes id forget a day and feel like shit or my insurance would lapse between jobs and theyd be crazy expensive i told myself i am stronger than i think then slowly weened myself off meds been off for years i always kept klonopin for emergency breakthrough anxiety but overall i did pretty dam well i had my ups and downs and anxiety would still present itself but it wasnt debilitating slowly but surely its been coming back pretty badly i notice especially in the last year and i think everything going on in the world with covid doom and gloom has exacerbated it pretty significantly i really want to try to overcome this without medication knowing its all in my head drives me insane i feel certain i can rewire my brain but i think it takes a lot of work talk therapy exercise eating right so much easier to take a pill but you also shouldnt be ashamed for deciding to go on meds i may have to if things dont improve

56,Having chest pains and am EXTREMELY worried.,"So I'm having some chest pains, and admittedly have been very anxious and my small dosage of Xanax has been out the last few days and I'm (still) waiting for my pharmacy. 

I worry about everything now especially because of Covid. Anytbing I touch, any cough I have, I live with my parents, I am FUCKING STRESSED. I haven't slept much these last 2 days as well because my mind will not shut off. 

Add in, I'm a very heavy, if not extreme, weed smoker. I know smoking causes heart problems, and I've lost lots of weight in the last 6-8 months from not eating a crazy amount and I do not exercise. 

I'm really anxious because I'm worried a heart attack is inevitable, but I also know anxiety can naturally cause chest pains. If I take a deep breathe in now, I don't feel anytbing in my chest. Every once in awhile though, towards the middle/top of my chest, I feel a bit of a pain or like something feels stuck or tensioned. It's not a 24/7 bothersome physically, but mentally it's freaking me out. I'm also worried it's the star of a viral infection, which of course could mean Covid. 

So, I'm not sure what to do. If anyone could please please please help or give me some guidance and comfort, I need it. I'm not sure what to think any more in all honesty, so that adds to my level of paranoia.",yep i get those all the time i go to the er they do an ekg and all the other heart tests and it always comes back as chest wall pain which is caused by anxiety ive seriously been to the er times in months from that

72,Struggling with how to quit lip picking,"Hi everyone,

I am 28 and I have suffered from anxiety as long as I can remember. I have had a lot of nasty habits over the years but the hardest one for me to kick is my lip picking. I'm going to go into some detail here but if it's TLDR any advice you have would be great! Thanks in advance.

I have clear memories of being around 5 years old and picking the skin from my lips in the bathroom mirror until they bled, but I honestly can't remember why I was doing it besides
perhaps, curiosity? 

As an adult I now mostly pick them subconsciously, especially while reading or scrolling social media. Sometimes I feel like I do it on purpose to help me concentrate, or clear my head. There are times when I only realize I'm doing it once it starts to hurt or I'm bleeding. On occasion I will pick them pretty raw and they are sore for days.

 If my lip gets a crack in it, you can forget it. I have one I have been struggling to let heal for about a month now. I just can't stand the dry skin or the bumps the scabs cause and I pick them off so my lips are ""smooth"" again. Most of the time I layer on some medicated chapstick before I go to sleep and pray it's healed when I wake up. 

My husband tries to help stop me when he notices it's happening and makes me aware or holds my hand, but the urge comes back almost within the minute. Sometimes I purposefully wait until he has left the room to go to town and then I hate myself afterwards. 

Sometimes I feel like I enjoy the pain? Or just the satisfaction I get from it and the pain is just a bonus? In the moment it might be great but the following hours/days of healing suck. I hate this habit and I hate how it makes me feel.

It has helped, but I've fallen back into old habits of being agoraphobia and I can't leave the house without panicking. I have an appointment with my dr today and I feel like I may need my dose upped to help me temporarily help with exposure therapy? Does anyone have advice?",i was on meds for about years i got so fed up with depending on them because sometimes id forget a day and feel like shit or my insurance would lapse between jobs and theyd be crazy expensive i told myself i am stronger than i think then slowly weened myself off meds been off for years i always kept klonopin for emergency breakthrough anxiety but overall i did pretty dam well i had my ups and downs and anxiety would still present itself but it wasnt debilitating slowly but surely its been coming back pretty badly i notice especially in the last year and i think everything going on in the world with covid doom and gloom has exacerbated it pretty significantly i really want to try to overcome this without medication knowing its all in my head drives me insane i feel certain i can rewire my brain but i think it takes a lot of work talk therapy exercise eating right so much easier to take a pill but you also shouldnt be ashamed for deciding to go on meds i may have to if things dont improve
74,does anyone feel like life is going too fast,I feel like weeks go by like seconds and get anxiety attacks thinking about me and my parents dying. Nothing feels real,i feel this way about lost that show meant a lot to me because it was how my family finally found something to bond over it was like a lifestyle of figuring out what was going on i discovered my love for writing with that show grantedi didnt like the last season im afraid if i rewatch it after watching so many good shows since it wont be the same i really want to but am afraid to i dont think its an anxiety thing for me probably just overthinking it some maybe is a genuine concern i mean there are a lot of things we used to like that seemed like the greatest ever and when we experience that again later in life its like okwhat was the big deal i think the point is for it to not feel the same or to not look for it to give us those same feelings or mean the same though that might be what we need and to just appreciate it for what it did for us back then
