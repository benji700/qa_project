30,I just really need some help :(,So I started struggling with anxiety off and on since I was 14 (currently 21) and it's really come to a head which I'm in college and has been especially bad in 2020 for obvious reasons. Within the past 2 months it's gotten reallyyy bad I can't sleep without taking melatonin (often not going to bed until between 2-4 am) and the sleep I do get is often restful or deep sleep and it's deeply impairing my brain functioning. It's causing conflicts with my parents (who I live with) bc I'm so agitated bc how high my anxiety is which is furthering the anxiety. I also often feel like I'm being choked and can't breathe and I've been shaking really bad lately too. It's honestly been so bad I seriously thought about calling out work today. Before the pandemic I was going to the gym everyday and that was really the only thing helping me but now they've been closed for 2 months and my state is opening them back up on Monday but I don't feel safe going back just yet. I go to a therapist every other week and have avoided going to a psychiatrist and getting on medication bc I'm worried about the potential side effects but it's honestly effecting me in every facet of my life and I really just need some advice bc idk what else to do at this point üôÉ,sounds like social anxiety to me mine first started when i was while walking through a mall when i randomly had my first panic attack from that day on it became worse and worse and here i am today years later still struggling i would highly suggest you try and do anything you can early on trust me ive never done a single thing about mine and i regret it so much its got to the point where my own friends and family give me so much anxiety that i can barely do anything around them i literally havent eaten a single thing at school in years and avoid eating when family is home im scared of every social interaction and scenario ever even the smallest things give me so much anxietymy biggest suggestion for you is that you speak to people about it and try and do anything you can to prevent it from becoming worse the earlier you do something about it the less chance you have for it becoming as bad as mine and many others if it does become worse and you cant get rid of it just know that you are not alone and there are many people who are willing to talk to you and help you out
29,"Have you noticed you can hit it off way easier with someone who has anxiety as opposed to someone you perceive as ""normal‚Äù?",I've noticed in my group of friends we all have some issues and I'm comfortable with them. But when I want to interact with someone who has their shit together and successful I get anxious. I just feel below them.,pregnancy hormones make it difficult to sleep in the first trimester pregnancy hormones also cause major mood swings in the first trimester toobeing pregnancy with your first child is a major life milestoneexperiencing anxiety is to be expectedbe gentle with yourself and just ride the waves of anxietytry your best to calm yourself without judging yourselfhowever that looks like for you adult coloring books meditation pregnancy yoga poses on youtube journaling calling someone you trust
31,Very anxious about graduating and finding a job due to past work trauma + lack of direction [also need hug and supportüòû],"I am currently doing a Bachelor of science, majoring in psychology, and I am about to graduate. My anxiety and over thinking has led me go question whether this was even the right path many tines, or whether I suit the work lifestyle we have now. I've caught myself overthinking multiple times over things I can't control (Why was I born in a society like this? Why am I like this? Why is the work life so demanding? Why can't I just live peacefully?), and it only frustrates me to the point where I cry myself to sleep. 

From this over thinking, I believe it all started when I worked at a cafe for 2 months, 3 years ago. It was my first job and the manager was really toxic - she would be question how I got into my degree (she assumed I academically dumb at first), yell at me when I wasn't fast enough (to be fair I find it really difficult to remember the proportions of ingredients for the drink because there was so many), and guilt trip me to quit. I felt like such a failure for not being able to work under pressure and remember things that other people could. Now I realise that the behaviour is toxic and not everyone is like that but it has really deepened my anxiety and depression, especially towards work. Since the cafe 3 years ago, I haven't worked since.

I guess another question I'd like to ask is how to deal with the feelings of anxiety and depression. Ive noticed that when Im stressed or frustrated, I have a very heavy feeling in my heart thats sometimes quite painful. like a tightening around the heart. I have tried exercising and sighing it out but it doesn't exactly help. I realised that this can last quite a while and is one of the causes to a spiral of anxious and depressive thoughts.

tl:dr I have anxiety and had work trauma and idk what to do now because I am about to graduate.",i had this problem once so i can only imagine how youre feeling right now is there any way you can visit your work sooner than your next shift i would say facing whatever consequence may come or not come would be the best course i know it can be difficult but trying to focus on a task youve been putting off or a chore that needs to be done if your mind is active with something else theres always the slight chance you could push out bits of anxiety talking to someone closetrustworthy for reassurance has a chance of helping getting outside input may reassure possible outcomes for you so theres less worry about what may happenlook at what is the best possible solution and try to prepare for the worst i know it can be nerveracking in itself to think about but it can also be calming to plan next steps in case of a worst case scenario situation ive seen posts that sour candies can help if you leave them on the tongue the sourness and grittiness can divert your mind ive never tried it but ive seen several things about this method cliche but physical activity possibly better if it were something like a guided workout that way you can focus on the instructions and then release endorphins as well or a run if you can do it in a safe area personallyive found physical contact and warm help calm me down laying down close to someone with their hand on me under a blanket soothes slightlyi always count now when im having an attack i will keep counting until my mind wanders if my mind wanders i restart and aim to get higher than my last count its helped calmed me down i really hope you find some kind of calm anxietys something i wish really didnt exist all the best to you and i hope everything can work out in your favor and get better from here
45,Anyone else feel like conversation is just a set of rules and ur always carefully following them and ur constantly trying to not be awkward or weird or talk too much about yourself?,"I dont know if its normal to be like this, sometimes I feel like maybe I have undiagnosed ADHD, but other times I think its just all the anxiety and depression from being a college drop out and being gay and trans. Like am I really this stupid and spacey or did I make myself stupider as a defense mechanism since I didn't have a reason to suddenly be so shit at school?",im going through the exact situation and its on its second year but the people that dont talk to me anymore arent really good people to begin with they are concerned with the ego and what people think of them instead of being genuinely good i believe what goes around comes around and that things will turn around for you

22,Job,I start a new job in 1 hour but I'm terrified and my stomach hurts I'm forcing myself to go but I feel horrible and I don't know what to do,i just left a not good for me job too it is so hard but its really worth it and you can do it congratulations for trusting yourself and getting out even if things are super stressful right now you will come through it and if it helps think of how much future you will appreciate what you did for yourself you got this
51,Is it a good idea to up my medication?,"I've been on 1MG of klonopin for years. It has helped, but I've fallen back into old habits of being agoraphobia and I can't leave the house without panicking. I have an appointment with my dr today and I feel like I may need my dose upped to help me temporarily help with exposure therapy? Does anyone have advice?",i was on meds for about years i got so fed up with depending on them because sometimes id forget a day and feel like shit or my insurance would lapse between jobs and theyd be crazy expensive i told myself i am stronger than i think then slowly weened myself off meds been off for years i always kept klonopin for emergency breakthrough anxiety but overall i did pretty dam well i had my ups and downs and anxiety would still present itself but it wasnt debilitating slowly but surely its been coming back pretty badly i notice especially in the last year and i think everything going on in the world with covid doom and gloom has exacerbated it pretty significantly i really want to try to overcome this without medication knowing its all in my head drives me insane i feel certain i can rewire my brain but i think it takes a lot of work talk therapy exercise eating right so much easier to take a pill but you also shouldnt be ashamed for deciding to go on meds i may have to if things dont improve
3,How do you find a stable partner?,"I look at r/Divorce sub and there are so many people contemplating divorce or divorcing everyday. Is it even possible to find a stable partner anymore? What is causing people to get married with the right one and then, all of a sudden, they are divorcing with kids sometimes? 

How do you find a stable partnership? I have had a lot of relationships but men were really unstable. I am more of a stable person. I want to stop attracting unstable partners. I'm just not sure where to start. I only work in a small office and everyone is in a stable marriage lol 

Thank you for your help! üòä",i understand what youre saying when i get really really anxious my brain feels like its closing almost does that even make any sense im not sure if its exactly what youre experiencing i will get overwhelmed with just this feeling of worry sometimes not about anything specific and my brain just feels like its locked in

15,How do I stop crying every time I do something slightly wrong?,"I am soooo tired of this. 
Like as soon as I make a small mistake I just can't stop crying even though I know its okay. Like I don't feel sad but I still cry a lot and cannot stop it!
The crying just makes me more anxious D:
Today I made a small error at work, fixed quickly and nothing bad came out of it but still I cried so much!!
Like it's so ridiculous but I don't know how to stop it.

Any advice? :(",i do it too im its been a problem for a few years now it makes it hard to live my life when im constantly worried how fast life is going and my teen years are already ending and ill be and then more years im im honestly not sure how to stop this from happening just try to live in the moment i guess but its pretty hard to live in the moment when you are thinking about living in the moment if that makes any sense just know you arent alone im pretty sure its normal
