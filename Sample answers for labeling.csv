8,"I am not suicidal, but I have such a sudden strong fear of death that I really need someone to talk to","Is calling the suicide hotline good for this situation? I called my local mental health clinic in my state but no ones there so I left a message(lockdown I assume). I don't know what number to call to actually get to somebody or set up an appointment somewhere(no insurance though) when my problem is the complete opposite of suicide.

I googled and its called death anxiety. Thing is I'm not sick(medically speaking like a terminal disease), I'm not 'surrounded' by death like sick family members or in the army. I've tried talking to myself that my death isn't going to come until I'm an old man(Im only 27) but it only slightly helped.

I want to say this started about a month ago, and it was really bad the first week. Since then there would be small moments where I would get kinda anxious, a little scared but not much. Then last night at like 3-4am I just started having such bad anxiety and fear that I think I had my first panic attack. I don't know how I slept but waking up I felt fine for a teeny bit before the anxiety came back, its not as bad as yesterday but I'm back to seeking help actively. Should I've made the thread in the mental health subreddit too? It's just this has gotten so bad so quickly but I haven't been diagnosed with anything as I've no money for a doctor and most aren't seeing patients cause of the lockdown. I thought about calling the suicide hotline but my problem is the polar opposite of what that lines for. I've come close to crying a few times but nothing yet, if you would've told me I'd be like this even 3 months ago I would've slapped the shit out of you, I have no idea why this is happening.",just the fact that youre alive at all is such a infinitely crazy miracle that even if you died during birth sorry for the grim thought youd have won the lottery considering the millions of other cells fighting to be bornthink about the fact that throughout all of history every one of your ancestors had to meet have kids those kids had to survive and meet their spouses and have kids just to give you a chance to race out at the right time to fertilize an egg and be borneveryone will die no matter if they worry about it all day or if they live their life to the fullest but i have found solace in thinking about the crazy miracle that i even get to die in the first place
57,I am very stressed out due to my university entrance exam and I had a huge miscomm with my girlfriend.,"Due to the coronavirus breakout, everything is messed up around the world. During this period, my university entrance exam changed a lot and I have high hopes and dreams. I have a girlfriend that I love and we had a huge fight yesterday. Before this, I already felt like a failure and sometimes had suicidal thoughts. After this fight, I feel very depressed and also anxious about everything. I can feel that my mental health is getting worst everyday. I am trying to control it but last incident broke me. I really dont know what to do.",from experience if everything is running smoothly that she is reassuring you often and that there is no problems in the relationship then you are good a relationship is all about trust mainly when it comes to long distance relationship if you trust her then dont worry and dont overthink too much
21,How do I keep a conversation going with someone I don't know that well?,"I've been isolated for a while. I'm REALLY good at first impression conversation #1. But my social anxiety kicks in when attempting to build relationships. I start to second guess everything i do/say. And this anxiety becomes a feedback loop of worries, so I psych myself out and can't think of things to say, lose the ability to be casual and I believe (could just be in my head) my convo with others feels awkward and forced.

For example, I met a women. She's a best friend of my coworker. I been trying to text her and see what's up. But I suck sooo bad at conversing that I feel like the convo goes nowhere and very quickly it turns into small talk and dies out. Basically there's no progression, because I sick bad at ""spitting game‚Äù or whatever you want to call it. This is a man/women context, but same stuff happens with most of my relationships in life.

Any suggestions on how to figure this stuff out? Am I alone in this or do you all have the Same issues with socialization?",no youre not crazysometimes talking to someone you feel comfortable with makes things all the better looking forward into the future is scary and hard so take every day as it comes and as hard as it is be optimistic ill be around if you need to talkrant and as i said earlier the most important thing is for you to release your feelings you have bottled up insidei hope for you all the best
2,How do you find a stable partner?,"I look at r/Divorce sub and there are so many people contemplating divorce or divorcing everyday. Is it even possible to find a stable partner anymore? What is causing people to get married with the right one and then, all of a sudden, they are divorcing with kids sometimes? 

How do you find a stable partnership? I have had a lot of relationships but men were really unstable. I am more of a stable person. I want to stop attracting unstable partners. I'm just not sure where to start. I only work in a small office and everyone is in a stable marriage lol 

Thank you for your help! üòä",i understand what youre saying when i get really really anxious my brain feels like its closing almost does that even make any sense im not sure if its exactly what youre experiencing i will get overwhelmed with just this feeling of worry sometimes not about anything specific and my brain just feels like its locked in
22,Job,I start a new job in 1 hour but I'm terrified and my stomach hurts I'm forcing myself to go but I feel horrible and I don't know what to do,i just left a not good for me job too it is so hard but its really worth it and you can do it congratulations for trusting yourself and getting out even if things are super stressful right now you will come through it and if it helps think of how much future you will appreciate what you did for yourself you got this
10,Ok I'll try this again- anyone ever been on Abilify? Can you pls tell me a little more about it? What my pharmacist said was confusing.,"Hi, I was just prescribed abilify and I was wondering if anyone would have any information about this drug? 

The pharmacist said to me 'You may have some thoughts. Contact your doctor if you don't like them.' when I picked it up. Half of me was like 'uhhhhh..... Yeah I sure hope I do have thoughts???' and the other half of me wondered what he could have even possibly meant. Suicidal thoughts? Why would anyone like those? Is that not what he meant? So confused lol 

Anyone have a really good or bad experience with it? My anxiety is constantly off the charts, I'd really like to be able to physically relax and maybe sleep without taking 4 different drugs to help me sleep that aren't successful half of the time bc I'm so physically uptight. 

Thanks in advance.",im much younger than you and i have these symptoms goes on for days and sometimes weeks breathing and heart gets so bad if you have concerns call your doctor or schedule an appointment
63,I'm 14 and I always feel like I'm going to die,"5 months ago, I had my first panic attack (Idk why) and it felt like my heart was going to stop beating. I always thought that I was going to die in my sleep or randomly. I searched that feeling on google and I found out that people actually did die because they felt like that. I was freaking out. I talked to a therapist but it didn't help much. Now, because I'm tired, I feel like I'm going to die.",remind yourself that teeth go a lot further down than what you can see you could look up xrays of teethjaws to reassure your brain that your teeth are very much attached even if they feel squishy right now also if youre new in the braces process it may help to know that in my experience at least its a very cyclical feeling you get a new wire and your gums feel squishy and painful for a bit but then your mouth starts to feel normal again by the time you go for your next appointment it always goes back to normal
72,Struggling with how to quit lip picking,"Hi everyone,

I am 28 and I have suffered from anxiety as long as I can remember. I have had a lot of nasty habits over the years but the hardest one for me to kick is my lip picking. I'm going to go into some detail here but if it's TLDR any advice you have would be great! Thanks in advance.

I have clear memories of being around 5 years old and picking the skin from my lips in the bathroom mirror until they bled, but I honestly can't remember why I was doing it besides
perhaps, curiosity? 

As an adult I now mostly pick them subconsciously, especially while reading or scrolling social media. Sometimes I feel like I do it on purpose to help me concentrate, or clear my head. There are times when I only realize I'm doing it once it starts to hurt or I'm bleeding. On occasion I will pick them pretty raw and they are sore for days.

 If my lip gets a crack in it, you can forget it. I have one I have been struggling to let heal for about a month now. I just can't stand the dry skin or the bumps the scabs cause and I pick them off so my lips are ""smooth"" again. Most of the time I layer on some medicated chapstick before I go to sleep and pray it's healed when I wake up. 

My husband tries to help stop me when he notices it's happening and makes me aware or holds my hand, but the urge comes back almost within the minute. Sometimes I purposefully wait until he has left the room to go to town and then I hate myself afterwards. 

Sometimes I feel like I enjoy the pain? Or just the satisfaction I get from it and the pain is just a bonus? In the moment it might be great but the following hours/days of healing suck. I hate this habit and I hate how it makes me feel.

Please help me quit. I've tried so many times.",this is super rude pls post this on glassdoor also i watch career tiktoks and self made millenial on youtube who has rly great content im apply for traineeships tho so interview process might be more chill good luck tho

15,How do I stop crying every time I do something slightly wrong?,"I am soooo tired of this. 
Like as soon as I make a small mistake I just can't stop crying even though I know its okay. Like I don't feel sad but I still cry a lot and cannot stop it!
The crying just makes me more anxious D:
Today I made a small error at work, fixed quickly and nothing bad came out of it but still I cried so much!!
Like it's so ridiculous but I don't know how to stop it.

Any advice? :(",i do it too im its been a problem for a few years now it makes it hard to live my life when im constantly worried how fast life is going and my teen years are already ending and ill be and then more years im im honestly not sure how to stop this from happening just try to live in the moment i guess but its pretty hard to live in the moment when you are thinking about living in the moment if that makes any sense just know you arent alone im pretty sure its normal
