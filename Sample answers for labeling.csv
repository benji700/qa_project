1,"Do I have telephobia? (and if so, what can I do in my situation)","Throughout my life I have always been anxious with telephone conversations - particularly with people I have not met face-to-face. I have recently read about telephobia (the fear of making or taking phone calls), and wondered whether it is something real and something that I genuinely suffer from.

I'm a UK secondary (high school) teacher (26M). I would describe myself as a charismatic and confident teacher. I love the social element of my job and have zero trouble with teaching classes or speaking in front of groups of people I have never met before.

Under lockdown, I have been asked by the school to phone call each of my students in my tutor group (around 30 students) once a week for a welfare check. Each phone call is around 5-10 minutes. In short, it is a phone call to have a conversation with parents/carers and their child to see if they are safe with living at home during lockdown.

I have forced myself to make these phone calls with success, however I experience the following:
- delaying the calls until Thursday/Friday, due to reluctance to make the calls
- taking around 20 minutes to mentally prepare myself to start the phone calls
- feelings of anxiousness whenever I remind myself about the phone calls
- refusal to call anyone while my girlfriend is at home (she works 5am-1pm every weekday), in fear of her hearing my conversation
- shaking and increased heart rate before, during and briefly after each phone call
- during the phone call, I speak well as long as I have my notes, despite the shaking and increased heart rate
- I don't stumble my words and the verbal flow of my side of the conversation seems to be fine

I really wish these calls could be all done via email but the school have said it must be a phone call, which I completely understand from a safeguarding point of view.

Question: Do I have telephobia and if so, what can I do to help with this situation?

Any help would be massively appreciated.",well i believe trying to stick to your am habit by that i mean going to your balcony i dont encourage smoking lol might help you face your fear and get over it like stand there and look down your yard and assure yourself that everythings alright maybe put up a source of light that focuses on that area of the yard in any case dont get obsessed by it rather face it and build immunity towards that fear just a thought hope it helps

3,"TW: Pet Death --- My partner and I have a 4 m.o. puppy, and I already have anxiety about when he will pass.","TW: Death of a Pet

&#x200B;

My partner and I picked up our goldendoodle puppy in early March, and let me start by saying I love him so, so much, and overall, he has helped with my GAD, especially with the current state of the world. At the end of the day though, all I can think about is if I'm going to do something that's going to be a potentially fatal mistake for the puppy, or how horrible it's going to be when it's his time to cross over the rainbow bridge in (hopefully) 12-15 years from now. In regards to the worries that I'm going to somehow hurt/kill my pup, I thought I would feel better now that he's all up to date with his heartworm & flea/tick medications, as well as vaccinations, but now I've just moved on to how scared I am of him dying years from now.  I'm trying to stay mindful and in the moment, but I'm definitely struggling, and it sucks, because it's taking away from enjoying my sweet puppy now. Does/has anyone struggled with something like this with their animal? If so, how did you manage it? 

[Puppy Tax, if you're interested](https://imgur.com/bgrjlWf)",ive recently had anxiety over death and being old having to come to terms with life in the sense of your born you live you die sounds quite abrupt and final but thats how ive been feeling i thought i had accepted and come to terms with it but evidently i havent ive also been questioning the point in life why and how it is meaningful i always seem to find a reason as to why it isnt im not suicidal nor do i have bad thoughts i want to live and have a happy life i think these thoughts are normal or normal to question and ponder at some point in your life when we have anxiety however it is how much we dwell and revisit these thoughts allowing them to take over our lives i was on antidepressants for the majority of my life and i feel as if i was numbed to any feelings of normal life anxieties like i expect everyone goes through it and now im off meds im being hit majorly by every emotion and feeling i missed out on you know unfortunately i havent had similar feelings of life not being real so i cant share any remedies or great words of comfort i do know a lot of people do feel this way though or experience it at least once in their life i have experienced the whole out of body experience and feeling of detachment from oneself through anxiety however its horrible and quite unsettling you do question if youre losing it i think when we have these thoughts perpetuating our anxiety whatever they may be we struggle with the horror of having to accept them as a reality as we have realised a truth and i think that scares us we dont know what to do with that information it provides us no comfort and we believe weve just gotta live with it i suppose we do its how we handle the the truth and process it that seems to make or break us how we choose to interpret it rebt methods can be quite good for rationalising these thoughts but theyre not helpful for everyone im being pushed to take meds again by family but i dont want them i dont want to be numb again i think if i had someone to talk to and rationalise these thoughts with put plans in place with and understand my thoughts and reactions to said thoughts id be fine or at least be on my way to feeling fine i know we dont know fully what thoughts were having and how it really is for each of us but i hope youre doing alright know that youre not crazy and it is normal to question life and death it perhaps just isnt normal how much we may dwell and allow our lives to be ruled by such thoughts im sorry if i have provided zero assistance or comfort but hopefully you take something from this even if its just knowing youre not alone with these thoughts others have them too take care
4,does anyone here have experience with emotional support animals?,"hi everyone! ive had generalised anxiety disorder for my entire life and recently its become a lot worse (due to the pandemic & me trying to complete my last year of high school). i happened to casually bring up the idea of a therapy animal in conversation with my mother the other day and even though nothing has been finalised as of yet she seems very enthusiastic!as ive never owned a pet before im a bit tentative, so if you own/have owned, or have stories about, emotional support animals, i would love to hear them! thanks guys :)",i sometimes take alprazolam very similar both benzodiazepines for panic attacks i also took what i think was valium before surgery to calm me for when they insert the iv where they insert the iv is super sensitive for me i despise it being touched and especially blood being drawn and it completely makes you blah like you just feel spaced out and sedated if that makes sense take anywhere from min to an hour before the time of your appointment you should start feeling effects after mins and itll just ramp up over time have someone drive you benzodiazepines are a controlled substance and ik you can get charged with dui for driving on them in some states even if it is legal still have someone drive you because you will be sedatedoh and dont drink any alcohol you blackout extremely easily im talking or beers anymore than that and you can go into respiratory failure never mix alcohol w valium
5,How do you find a stable partner?,"I look at r/Divorce sub and there are so many people contemplating divorce or divorcing everyday. Is it even possible to find a stable partner anymore? What is causing people to get married with the right one and then, all of a sudden, they are divorcing with kids sometimes? 

How do you find a stable partnership? I have had a lot of relationships but men were really unstable. I am more of a stable person. I want to stop attracting unstable partners. I'm just not sure where to start. I only work in a small office and everyone is in a stable marriage lol 

Thank you for your help! 😊",lol yea i sometimes imagine how my life wouldve been without social anxiety i imagine watching my clone self laughing and talking with a group of people as im in the background still anxious

Thank you for your help! 😊",im sorry to hear youre struggling to be honest i dont think the real problem is your social skills since those naturally develop with enough time and practice instead of stressing out over every awkward moment you experience practice being okay with them the worst case is that you feel embarrassed for a short time and then the moment passesplease be kinder to yourself and stop beating yourself up constantly you have a lot of expectations for how you would like to be or maybe how you think you should be constantly comparing yourself to this standard is causing a lot of extra suffering for yourself you can of course keep working on yourself and making improvements to your social skills but radical changes probably arent going to happen overnight in the mean time be compassionate with yourself and learn to be okay with who you are right now
7,"I am not suicidal, but I have such a sudden strong fear of death that I really need someone to talk to","Is calling the suicide hotline good for this situation? I called my local mental health clinic in my state but no ones there so I left a message(lockdown I assume). I don't know what number to call to actually get to somebody or set up an appointment somewhere(no insurance though) when my problem is the complete opposite of suicide.

I googled and its called death anxiety. Thing is I'm not sick(medically speaking like a terminal disease), I'm not 'surrounded' by death like sick family members or in the army. I've tried talking to myself that my death isn't going to come until I'm an old man(Im only 27) but it only slightly helped.

I want to say this started about a month ago, and it was really bad the first week. Since then there would be small moments where I would get kinda anxious, a little scared but not much. Then last night at like 3-4am I just started having such bad anxiety and fear that I think I had my first panic attack. I don't know how I slept but waking up I felt fine for a teeny bit before the anxiety came back, its not as bad as yesterday but I'm back to seeking help actively. Should I've made the thread in the mental health subreddit too? It's just this has gotten so bad so quickly but I haven't been diagnosed with anything as I've no money for a doctor and most aren't seeing patients cause of the lockdown. I thought about calling the suicide hotline but my problem is the polar opposite of what that lines for. I've come close to crying a few times but nothing yet, if you would've told me I'd be like this even 3 months ago I would've slapped the shit out of you, I have no idea why this is happening.",i had this a lot in my teens i think we all experience it at some stage in our life even to this day the idea is unsettling but how i stopped worrying is by realistic that death is unavoidable and spending my life worrying about it wont change the outcome i know its easier said than done but one day i just stopped torturing myself
8,Is there a way calming yourself mid panic attack?,I suffer from anxiety disorder and I get frequent panic attacks. This quarantine has made it worse for me cause everyone around me is busy and I'm so lonely. During the past few days I've been getting more anxious and been having regular panic attacks that are very uncomfortable and lead to me crying a lot. Whenever I feel it coming I try to breath and calm myself down but it just seems to get worse. Does anyone know a way to calm yourself when you feel it coming?,for me its usually a combination of my body already being in an elevated state like after exercising having eaten a lot or already anxious in general and then a sudden feeling of fear like i will lose control of the bodily situation or have trouble breathing i heard a book that described agoraphobia not as a fear of public places and open spaces but as a fear of fear itself i think that kind of described a lot of panic attacks you just sort of start surging with this fearful feeling and it frightens you

10,Confusing,Whenever people come up to me and say hi or hey does this mean they want to talk to me or that there just saying hi. One of my friends told me that's how ppl start conversations. The only problem with this is that l I don't realize and whenever I do I just give 1 or two-word responses.,i have terrible anxiety with grocery shopping something that helps me is listening to music while shopping usually an instrumental playlist also making a shopping list ahead of time if im familiar enough with the store ill list everything by the way id shop through the building the list keeps me from wandering aimlessly and becoming overwhelmed neither things help me get up and go to the store as soon as i need to but it does make a difference in the shop i hope this helps you some

12,To give my dog the walks that he deserves,"I have recently stopped walking my dog around because of the stress I get from saying good morning to people. (I usually go at the ass crack of dawn because there's only 3 people I need to ""interact with"" rather than like 7 I guess)

My predicament:

I walk and then a stranger says good morning. Sometimes if I'm too scared, I'll just look down at the ground before they even come close to me to avoid talking.

Result: I feel horrible, they probably feel horrible 

 If I look up, and they try to make eye contact, I panic. They say the good 'ol ""morning!"". I don't respond because I'm busy panicking and I react too slow.

Result: I think that they hate me and I hate myself for it

I tried to make the first move a few times and I say good morning like a brave little girl. It fizzles out like a flat soda and I mumble. 

Result: I say ""gmurnen"" and only mosquitoes can actually hear me

Am I missing a clear compromise here or do I have to keep powering through staring at the ground or those stupid ""gmurnen""s?

&gt; I actually haven't been diagnosed officially, but I stress about these social interactions so much to the point where I just assume I have it.",hey i was more or less in the same situation as you ive always loved walking but being really anxious about other people i stayed indoor but now i overcame that and ive been taking long walks without too much worry the solution is keeping going out and slowly your mind will begin to accept it as normal as for the other peoplenow you asked what to do when walking past them id say everything you said is fine during my walks i couldnt help but notice that most people either watch who they pass by some dont some say hello and so on my point is that most people dont really care about that there isnt a rule it is our mind that make that seems like it is a big deal sorry for my english

14,Fake friends????,"Do you think you're re always the one putting in efforts, always the one being walked over and pushed around and no one really cares about what you want/think/feel but they do something slightly nice for you once in a while and you think you OWE your friendship to them? 
And they just keep using you, manipulating you! And in the end I keep feeling bad because I wish I was more important or even a little important in someone's life. 
It's so frustrating to see how people hung out with you because their other friends weren't around or you were the only last option left. 
It's really bothering me can someone tell me what I should do. This feeling is so hurtful and it just comes randomly and I just don't want to feel like trash all the time.",i like ordering a beer and the same plate as others questioning on casual subjects i can relate to others such as what everyone is doing for a living then i will tell what i do so everyone get to know each others more

16,Do I have anxiety,"Hi users of r/Anxiety I feel like I have social anxiety but I don't know if it's true or not. I'm too scared to ask my mom to go to a therapist so I'm asking the people of r/ Anxiety. I don't know how to explain it but here are some things I'm afraid of/ get anxious about: 

Groups of people (usually two or more) 
Being around more than one person. That probably doesn't make sense but I usually like to hang out with myself and one other person or people I trust or feel comfortable with but most of the time it's me and one other person because when I'm with a group nobody listens to me or I don't say anything at all because nobody pays attention (I'm a threes a crowd kinda person) 
Afraid of talking or going anywhere. Probably doesn't make sense either but I don't like to talk or go anywhere too much because I'm scared that I'll say or do something so stupid that nobody will let it go and I'll die of embarrassment (that's dramatic) but I'll have a full blown conversation with someone I'm comfortable with or someone that's willing to listen to me.. I can talk for hours with you if your the right person.

But anyway I just want some advice or suggestions about what I just talked about.. feel free to comment, some of your comments might me really helpful for me!

That's all, thank you for your time 🌸",ha this is actually funny because back in november i woke up one morning with those exact symptoms and a couple of fun extras i was unfamiliar with the symptoms of anxiety at the time so my anxious mind as it always does jumped to the worst possible outcome and i started fretting about having als or something like that the more i worried the worse it got and the more i worried etc so for me personally anxiety became self sustaining as it would manifest itself in physical symptoms which i would then get anxious about and so on im not sure if you could call that a source or not but the symptoms were always at the forefront of my concious and they certainly felt like what was causing the anxiety even though they themselves were caused by anxiety i think what made me so anxious in the first place causing me to wake up in november shaking and stuff was just college and not wanting to go back since it was the first day back after a week offbut this doesnt answer your question the anxiety about college thing is actually kind of a stretch because though not happy about going back i wasnt actively worrying about it what i belive is that people like us are just generally predisposed to worrying even if there isnt necessarily anything to worry about i think worrying needlessly and perhaps even obsessively is what defines anxiety and seperates it from just general worrying anxiety doesnt require a reason to thrive because its a mental illness depressed people often arent depressed because of something thats happened to them they just cant get happy because they have depression what im suggesting is that looking for a source might lead you nowhere there may be no source in the first place all i can suggest is in stead of attempting to find the source of your anxiety look for something you can find solace in a person an environment anything to distract you from the way you are feeling and eventually youll start to feel normal again in my experience talking about it with someone who understands you always helps these things take time a lot of it usually just try to make the most of this period of your life in which you are anxious despite the circumstances since its only temporary and not allowing it to consume you is all you can do i hope this helps sorry if my overly analytical approach to consoling you has only made you feel worse feel free to dm me if you want to talk about anything i am rather an experienced worryer after all and id be happy to listen
18,Anyone else feel like conversation is just a set of rules and ur always carefully following them and ur constantly trying to not be awkward or weird or talk too much about yourself?,"I dont know if its normal to be like this, sometimes I feel like maybe I have undiagnosed ADHD, but other times I think its just all the anxiety and depression from being a college drop out and being gay and trans. Like am I really this stupid and spacey or did I make myself stupider as a defense mechanism since I didn't have a reason to suddenly be so shit at school?",i constantly feel like this i think my friends are honestly more annoyed with me asking them if its okay to even ask them basic things and not liking to talk to them about myselfif they said they were okay with it and you know they would say it if they werent it sounds to me as if youre all good
19,Heartbeat,"If you have anxiety, you probably well aware how hard it is to stay concrete and act like a normal human being with your heart thumping twice as faster around people.

Because my heart beat way too fast, Im sweating (thankfully my face never sweat much, so theyre unaware, but I had to wear baggy clothes to hide my body), my face twitch occasionally because damn its hard not to bend over and breathe raggedly cuz I feel like im running marathon. My stomach is not helping either.

How do I control my heartbeat so it beat normally when Im nervous?",yes i have bad health anxiety as well and went down a lymphoma huntrabbit hole the day after i read night sweats were a symptom i had them for three nights straight even though ive never had them since i was a child lol all anxiety induced especially if that node came back clear youre fine

I'd need the carona vaccine when that comes out due to my severe asthma I can't risk catching it and I also can't risk giving it to the at risk I live and work with, thanks for your time!",the only thing that can help you is time therapy and medical treatment you need treatment to find the right medication to help you control your ocd and anxiety you need therapy to find coping mechanisms to deal with your ocd anxiety and overthinking you need to become more self aware to catch yourself when youre saying and doing things that will upset others and also to be able to avoid triggers and how to best manage your needs you need to mature i would also consider a cardio routine and a strict bed and wake time as well as a general daily routine to keep you grounded but you need to speak to a professional asap
24,I keep deleting every single comment I make on a post,I don't know why I keep doing this but a few minutes ago I was trying to give someone advice but got stuck for 3 minutes trying to see if everything I wrote was perfect and had no mistakes. I really want to comment on posts without having to delete the comment 5000 times.,since you mentioned drinking tea im assuming liquids are somewhat manageable in that case try anything liquid with calories juice smoothies soda nonchunky soup there are also nutrition shakes you can get at pharmacies that are made specifically to be nutritionally dense often used to stop sick or elderly people from losing too much weightwhen you eat try chewing the food until your swallowing reflex automatically makes you swallow some of iteat smaller meals if full size meals make you feel unwell

I really want to comment on posts without having to delete the comment 5000 times.,like others have mentioned below its all about just doing it i know that sounds extremely vague and stupid but when people say fake it till you make it what that actually looks like is doing everything you want to do for yourself and dont think about it dont think about it before you do it while youre doing and after youve done itfor example i want to ask this random kid in my class a question and he happens to be cute and i want to get to know him instead of thinking oh god im so ugly hes gonna think im a weirdo im so shy what if he ignores me i just say to myself fuck it im going to do it i will literally say that to myself quietly then i ignore every physical reaction i have from my anxiety and do what i need to do then i accept the outcome whether good or bad i dont think about it i just let it happen and continue with whatever i was doing its mostly about confronting your thoughts anxieties and saying no i will not listen to you thank you seeing the thought then letting it pass its a mental sort of olympics in a lot of ways you have to act as though you are in a play and pretend youre a character in this play sometimes when i go into new social situations i try to act like im acting in a play and make everything very comical when i think like this i go into this state of mind where everything is comical someone looks at me the wrong way i laugh it off someone ignores me i laugh it off i talk to someone and i act confident even when i know im not confident at all sometimes i even find myself emulating characters in movies or shows just to have a bit of confidence when im out in the real world and personally i always thought the whole shoulders thing was bullshit confidence isnt all that physical its very much mental the mental process will evoke a physical manifestation in other words when you act like the popular kid you suddenly become the popular kid i did this all the time in high school even though i felt like an ugly depressed loser i still feel that way but at least now i can convince people im not the loser i feel like i am see its all acting wishing you lots of luck i believe in you lt
