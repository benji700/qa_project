1,"Do I have telephobia? (and if so, what can I do in my situation)","Throughout my life I have always been anxious with telephone conversations - particularly with people I have not met face-to-face. I have recently read about telephobia (the fear of making or taking phone calls), and wondered whether it is something real and something that I genuinely suffer from.

I'm a UK secondary (high school) teacher (26M). I would describe myself as a charismatic and confident teacher. I love the social element of my job and have zero trouble with teaching classes or speaking in front of groups of people I have never met before.

Under lockdown, I have been asked by the school to phone call each of my students in my tutor group (around 30 students) once a week for a welfare check. Each phone call is around 5-10 minutes. In short, it is a phone call to have a conversation with parents/carers and their child to see if they are safe with living at home during lockdown.

I have forced myself to make these phone calls with success, however I experience the following:
- delaying the calls until Thursday/Friday, due to reluctance to make the calls
- taking around 20 minutes to mentally prepare myself to start the phone calls
- feelings of anxiousness whenever I remind myself about the phone calls
- refusal to call anyone while my girlfriend is at home (she works 5am-1pm every weekday), in fear of her hearing my conversation
- shaking and increased heart rate before, during and briefly after each phone call
- during the phone call, I speak well as long as I have my notes, despite the shaking and increased heart rate
- I don't stumble my words and the verbal flow of my side of the conversation seems to be fine

I really wish these calls could be all done via email but the school have said it must be a phone call, which I completely understand from a safeguarding point of view.

Question: Do I have telephobia and if so, what can I do to help with this situation?

Any help would be massively appreciated.",i can related to finding myself in a situation like this and ruminating on it i feel no judgement towards you for this situation and i actually really appreciate your willingness to share about an embarrassing situation i also can relate to the feeling of thinking that i should just laugh at myself and move on its not always so easy to do i hope that you start to feel better and feel free to send a chat if youd like thank you for sharing this

3,"Long time lurker, scared to take the first step towards therapy.","Hi all, I've been a part of this sub for a long time but never posted. I met with a new GP for our first appointment virtually and when she saw my diagnosis of anxiety was very encouraging about pursuing therapy, and even gave me some good advice about finding a therapist.

But the idea of even pursuing therapy frightens me. I worry that maybe I'm ""misdiagnosed”, or my anxiety isn't bad enough. I feel like I'm not good at being able to explain my symptoms or my thoughts and feelings.  I question myself wondering if I really need it, even though a part of me feels like I do.

I guess I'm wondering if anyone else here has felt the same way and how they moved past it?",try to remember its not a race take however long you need to feel content im personally not finished with therapy but i imagine its not as if one day ill complete a session and a switch will flip in my head and ill say okay im done now thanks for everythingi see it a bit like getting older theres milestones and such but you dont instantly feel different upon reaching them change is subtle and hard to pick up on after all

5,Does anyone out there have anxiety attacks that are purely physical?,"I have always struggled with no one understanding how my anxiety attacks are and not being able to explain them in a way people understand. It gets incredibly frustrating for both parties and just makes it worse for me sometimes. My anxiety attacks are totally a physical experience. I don't have racing thoughts, in fact, I could be thinking about rainbows and cheeseburgers and have a full blown anxiety attack. My head gets insanely tingly out of nowhere and even though I know it's an anxiety attack, I panic that there's something physically wrong with me and it just spirals from there.  I've always been a hypochondriac, and when I was younger and learned the symptoms of stroke, heart attack, etc, my body would literally mimic the symptoms during an anxiety attack (but again, my actual thoughts would be fine up until that point). I've become a pro at looking cool as a cucumber exteriorly, which is great, except no one takes me seriously when I'm in the middle of a seriously bad anxiety attack. Anytime I have one and disclose that to someone, they will (innocently and kindly) ask, ""well what are you anxious about?” And it's like I am anxious about absolutely nothing, my body just feels weird out of nowhere and it's terrifying.

Does anyone else experience this? Do you have any coping mechanisms that help you? How do you explain it to people that are close to you so that they understand?",yes for me it does iti often freak out about my health and the corresponding part of my body will often start hurting then this feeling goes away after i switch my attention to something else this physical feeling makes it much harder to switch though

Does anyone else experience this? Do you have any coping mechanisms that help you? How do you explain it to people that are close to you so that they understand?",yes the mind can be very powerful a wellknown example is the placebo effect on a personal level ive found that some of my fears have lead to very real physical feelings in my body which then lead to physical symptoms of anxiety

How do you explain it to people that are close to you so that they understand?",yes it can when im highly anxious ill get a sharp pain in chest then thats all i can think about to the point it feels like it grows then my shoulder hurts then i think im having a heart attack so i get pain in my neck because i recall reading thats how female heart attacks can present then i think tigress its anxiety so it all recedes my son hurt his thumb three weeks ago anyone touch it it would hurt yesterday the paediatrician was checking it out she said to him if his anxious brain thinks it will hurt it will hurt today his thumbs feeling better he realised it was just anxiety
8,does anyone here have experience with emotional support animals?,"hi everyone! ive had generalised anxiety disorder for my entire life and recently its become a lot worse (due to the pandemic & me trying to complete my last year of high school). i happened to casually bring up the idea of a therapy animal in conversation with my mother the other day and even though nothing has been finalised as of yet she seems very enthusiastic!as ive never owned a pet before im a bit tentative, so if you own/have owned, or have stories about, emotional support animals, i would love to hear them! thanks guys :)",im not a scientist but ive been told those medications pretty much suck up all the adrenaline so you just dont have any the first time i took a xanax i remember feeling a panic attack coming on but it never got there it was like i physically could not panic it was amazing hopefully your meds will work the same for you

10,How do I slow down my heart rate to sleep?,"I'm a 18yr female btw 
2 months ago I discovered I have an anxiety disorder due to rushing the ER thinking I was having a heart attack, after a few tests it turned out my heart is healthy and I was just having a panic attack. *currently while typing this I feel like I'm going to have one pretty soon* 

The past few weeks I've been having heart palpitations and a really fast heart rate and that freaks me out because I think I'm going to die and then I start crying and spiral. My anxiety for some reason also seems to spike at night while I'm trying to go to bed. Does anyone know how to stop this? Or maybe calm down my ""you are going to die!!” thoughts ? 

Or Any advice on how to deal with anxiety ?",yes for years i used beta blockers for a while but i didnt really find them helpfulbut for you they can be great the racing heart constantly makes me feel like my chest is so tight too im on ssri hoping they would eventually help with my heart its one of my worst anxiety disorder symptoms my heart races for nothing and it used to be so bad that i had to sit down a lot because couldnt bear walking or standing i think my body is just somehow so out of control my heart is racing all the time

Or Any advice on how to deal with anxiety ?",this happens to me and still somewhat happens to me i went the whole route of going to the doctors and doing heart scan only to have them tell me nothing is wrong with me and i believe them bc several years later i am still alive and healthy what i realized is that it more than likely isnt our heart but that muscele twitching that is over our chest where our heart is bc when i grab it it no longer happens youre going to be okay bc i too was once in your shoes
12,always afraid of sending my picture online,"so i'm always afraid of sending my picture to people i meet online and there are a lot of times where i like the other person but the anxiety of them not gonna like how i look draws me back and they leave. even in the rare cases where i send my picture, i ends up to be not their type (which basically their kind way of saying you're ugly) and that what makes me think twice before sending it. now i'm in the same situation, the other person is asking for my picture and i really like him but i'm just so afraid of what they're gonna think of me! any advice?

p.s. i don't really think i'm ugly",i think you just have to accept that it isnt your fault this shit was in the movie to begin withif youre seeking out these films for that purpose then id go see a therapist or something and express your concerns because you havent broken any laws but the thoughts are causing you distress and its clear you understand the eventual consequences of such thoughts but simply having access to a film that has children being children in it isnt necessarily a crime

16,I just really need some help :(,So I started struggling with anxiety off and on since I was 14 (currently 21) and it's really come to a head which I'm in college and has been especially bad in 2020 for obvious reasons. Within the past 2 months it's gotten reallyyy bad I can't sleep without taking melatonin (often not going to bed until between 2-4 am) and the sleep I do get is often restful or deep sleep and it's deeply impairing my brain functioning. It's causing conflicts with my parents (who I live with) bc I'm so agitated bc how high my anxiety is which is furthering the anxiety. I also often feel like I'm being choked and can't breathe and I've been shaking really bad lately too. It's honestly been so bad I seriously thought about calling out work today. Before the pandemic I was going to the gym everyday and that was really the only thing helping me but now they've been closed for 2 months and my state is opening them back up on Monday but I don't feel safe going back just yet. I go to a therapist every other week and have avoided going to a psychiatrist and getting on medication bc I'm worried about the potential side effects but it's honestly effecting me in every facet of my life and I really just need some advice bc idk what else to do at this point 🙃,sounds like social anxiety to me mine first started when i was while walking through a mall when i randomly had my first panic attack from that day on it became worse and worse and here i am today years later still struggling i would highly suggest you try and do anything you can early on trust me ive never done a single thing about mine and i regret it so much its got to the point where my own friends and family give me so much anxiety that i can barely do anything around them i literally havent eaten a single thing at school in years and avoid eating when family is home im scared of every social interaction and scenario ever even the smallest things give me so much anxietymy biggest suggestion for you is that you speak to people about it and try and do anything you can to prevent it from becoming worse the earlier you do something about it the less chance you have for it becoming as bad as mine and many others if it does become worse and you cant get rid of it just know that you are not alone and there are many people who are willing to talk to you and help you out

18,Having chest pains and am EXTREMELY worried.,"So I'm having some chest pains, and admittedly have been very anxious and my small dosage of Xanax has been out the last few days and I'm (still) waiting for my pharmacy. 

I worry about everything now especially because of Covid. Anytbing I touch, any cough I have, I live with my parents, I am FUCKING STRESSED. I haven't slept much these last 2 days as well because my mind will not shut off. 

Add in, I'm a very heavy, if not extreme, weed smoker. I know smoking causes heart problems, and I've lost lots of weight in the last 6-8 months from not eating a crazy amount and I do not exercise. 

I'm really anxious because I'm worried a heart attack is inevitable, but I also know anxiety can naturally cause chest pains. If I take a deep breathe in now, I don't feel anytbing in my chest. Every once in awhile though, towards the middle/top of my chest, I feel a bit of a pain or like something feels stuck or tensioned. It's not a 24/7 bothersome physically, but mentally it's freaking me out. I'm also worried it's the star of a viral infection, which of course could mean Covid. 

So, I'm not sure what to do. If anyone could please please please help or give me some guidance and comfort, I need it. I'm not sure what to think any more in all honesty, so that adds to my level of paranoia.",yep i get those all the time i go to the er they do an ekg and all the other heart tests and it always comes back as chest wall pain which is caused by anxiety ive seriously been to the er times in months from that

22,I've (21f) never been vaccinated,"Hello everyone! I thought I'd come back to my favourite subreddit once again since this is a nice helpful place.

So i grew up with a narcissistic control freak who also I swear has paranoid anxiety, thus meaning I've never been vaccinated because of all the ""risks” involved with the vaccines back in ‘98 apparently.

Now I happen to have really bad crippling anxiety (which is getting better day by day very slowly) due to my upbringing and am also heavily paranoid about ANY sort of medication or vaccine going into my body, hell I can even have a panic attack over trying a new moisturiser because I think I'm going to be allergic and swell up and die (I do have an actual severe allergy so I think it also stems from that). I recently caught mumps which was top 3 worst experiences of my life, the others being food poisoning and my ex, lol. Would anyone have any advice at all on what to do about this? I'd need the carona vaccine when that comes out due to my severe asthma I can't risk catching it and I also can't risk giving it to the at risk I live and work with, thanks for your time!",first of all im sending you a big hug im sure youre not as bad as you feel you are i was saying this to someone else too but the reason why you feel like no one likes you is because you dont like yourself which you said i think about this a lot would i want to socialise with me well no because im not relaxed i often try to read into things and people and i literally dont live i just think think think you probably have encounters with people which are positive too but not to your high standard because youre so critical of yourself now about how to solve this it is a tough one obviously you dont want medication or therapy you might need to just be upfront honest about your condition and slip it in when you talk to people youll weed out the ones who wont relate or who are judgemental arses and the good ones will stay because they know your story try to work from that
