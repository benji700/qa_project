47,My parents go through my phone while I sleep,"Hey guys, I'm not sure if this is okay for me to post because I've never really been here beefore but what's going on has made me extremely anxious and I'm staying up until 4am because I'm petrified to sleep and I'm hoping someone might have some answers for me


So basically my door has a lock on it but my parents have a key too it, they've always been high preaching people with privacy and never lying to me and for the past year I've been telling them how I think someone has been accessing my phone throughout the night while I slept but they basically just called me crazy, for a long time I thought that it was a stranger but now, even with no evidence I believe it's my parents, recently they went through my brothers wallet looking for condoms (he's 18) while he wasn't around and made me swear not to tell him, obviously I lost trust iny parents from that day on but my friend agreed with me, she also wouldn't put it past my parents to do this, as I'm only 17 I know I can't do anything legally but the weird noises and random stuff on my phone stopped for a few months but around a month ago they started again, just after I got my P plates and became more individual about my life, two nights ago I fell asleep at around 4am and woke up at 2pm ish, when I turned on my phone it opened straight to a covid 19 website which I hadn't searched in well over a month, this shows that I'm not crazy, someone has been going on my phone while I sleep and the only people with motive are my over protective helicopter parents, I've since taken my finger print ID off so that they need my password, any ideas on what else I could do? I really want to get back to falling asleep and feeling safe in my own house. The only thing that has me baffled is why they would search up the covid website unless they were going through my history and accidentally clicked it? They're not tech savvy in the slightest but they're not dumb enough to leave a website open for me to find",i would suggest finding other methods of relaxing yourself that dont involve your phone yoga and stretching listening to music breathing exercises taking a showerbath etc etc itll be different for everyone it might also help to put your phone somewhere where you cant use it in bed like plugging it in across the room thatll help you wake up easier too haha
26,I always feel like I'm going to die,"Hey everyone, I wasn't sure where to go but I need to vent or get some advice. I have had depression and chronic anxiety since I was about the age of 11. I've managed to keep it under control for a good portion of my life but recently I feel like I've lost control of everything. My father called me last week, telling me he wanted to end his own life and I also found out my best friend from high school passed away which I think may have triggered it. 
I've started having severe panic attacks to where I physically feel like I'm dying, my chest gets heavy, I start to tingle or go numb, can't catch my breath and I'm already asthmatic (and I hyper focus on this). Im definitely over using my rescue inhaler. I'm so worried something is actually wrong with me. All I do is cry. I feel Ike I'm turning into a hypochondriac. When this happen I feel completely disconnected and out of touch. 
I saw my PCP on Thursday last week and changed my meds from Prozac to Wellbutrin, Ativan and Symbicort. The Ativan helps a lot when they happen, but it's not something I want to be dependent on. She wants to do some labs in a few weeks and do some blood work to check my thyroid which could be a huge contributing factor if that's the case. 
I don't even want to leave my house some days because I'm afraid it's going to happen out in public, I have to force myself to go do things. I don't think my friends and family know the severity of it. I feel so lost and alone. 
I feel like this has come out of no where and I don't know how to stop it.",remind yourself that teeth go a lot further down than what you can see you could look up xrays of teethjaws to reassure your brain that your teeth are very much attached even if they feel squishy right now also if youre new in the braces process it may help to know that in my experience at least its a very cyclical feeling you get a new wire and your gums feel squishy and painful for a bit but then your mouth starts to feel normal again by the time you go for your next appointment it always goes back to normal
43,How do you know when to quit,"So I typically deal with anxiety on a fairly consistent basis. Since covid however a lot of things that gave me anxiety haven't been an issue since isolation. Recently however I had to start back up again on a side job. This job causes me a lot of stress and anxiety but I push through it because I need money, and I don't want to stop doing things just because my anxiety is acting up. So my question is how do you know when to stop and let yourself rest? When should I push through the anxiety vs. stop and reset? Idk if that makes sense though",doesnt really matter the diagnosis its significantly disrupting your life go speak to a professional and yes this sounds a lot like social anxiety
1,How to feel wanted in a group?,"Apologies for the wall of text

So, I've been going to college for a year now, my major is pretty small so I know everybody in it.

I was texting a guy from my school yesterday, and he ended up adding me to a Facebook group that had all the guys in the major but me in it. The group was made a couple of months ago. 

I don't know how to feel. It's like, these dudes have all been hanging out and doing activities together for a couple of months and I don't know why I was excluded.

Now that I'm in the group I feel uncomfortable like I'm not really wanted there, like I was only added because this one dude liked me and the rest of them don't really. 

And then it's like, they're all getting together on Saturday, and now that I'm in the group I'm invited. But I feel like I shouldn't go because of covid and my history of lung problems, and at the same time I feel like if I don't go then I'll be even more excluded from the group. 

I just don't know how to feel like they like me. I want to make friends, but somehow being added to the group has made me feel even more excluded. It's a paradox. I'm so anxious about saying too much and making things uncomfortable, or saying too little and being weird, and knowing if I should hang out with them or not. I'd just really appreciate any advice. 

TLDR, got added to a group of other guys, but since I got added so late I feel excluded and awkward.",your over thinking stop caring what others thinkat the end of the day everyone is going to end up ft under ground why care what others think or be scared that your awkward i learned to stop caring about others and my life is better once u stop caring about others and their opinions youll be able to do anything
4,I can't sleep because I'm scared of being schizophrenic. How do I stop these thoughts?,"Let me start off by saying I have never had any hallucinations or voices in my head.

My dad's dad was apparently schizophrenic and I wish they never told me. My cousin (grandchild of my dad's grandma's sister) on my dad's side is also schizophrenic, she seemed normal to me when I was younger and I looked up to her. Now she's not functioning normally and I'm scared.

I have used drugs before but not for years, but I do smoke once in a blue moon. I suffer from really bad anxiety. I've been lacking motivation in school and stuff in general.

It's 5:30 in the morning and I can't sleep because I'm 22 years old and it comes in the late twenties for females. I am so scared, how do I stop worrying about this? I really want to sleep now but I also know even when I do sleep that I will still be thinking about this.

Someone please help me. :(",if you think you would benefit from a counsellor or psychiatrist then i certainly encourage you to check those resources out whether thats in person or remotely beyond that ive been having a lot of night time anxiety as well where it feels like i cant shut my brain off and my body just wants to move and jiggle ive been taking melatonin which is just an over the counter sleep aid it doesnt work super well for me but others swear by it have you been exercising i find when i get a good workout in my brain respons really well to that and i often sleep a bit better that night then theres always meditation and journalling your thoughts those are great tools as well im not sure what youre already doing to deal with anxiety and nervousness so i dont exactly know what to suggest your you maybe if part of the anxiety is your thoughts going too fast for you to be able to control try to write them all down itll force you to slow down just a bit and maybe reflect on them
37,Nightmares of former friend,"I just want to preface this that I can't afford therapy at this moment because I moved home from college because of covid-19 and lost my job. I'm currently 25 years old. 

One year ago, I let a friend stay at my apartment for six weeks due to a divorce he was going through. During the time he stayed at my apartment, he almost got me kicked out for smoking weed when I told him not to. He was incredibly rude and would invite friends over without permission and would get easily offended over everything. 

I finally had enough when I asked him to keep the music down once when I was trying to get to bed. He started banging on my bedroom door and was screaming as loud as he could that he was going to kill me. I kicked him out the next day and he would send me really bizarre videos ranting about things with his shirt off.

Since then, I've blocked his phone number and all of his social media accounts and haven't heard from him since. I've had nightmares about him at least once a week for around six months. If I hear a weird noise at home (my apartment and my family's home both creak), I'm immediately in fear because I imagine him breaking into my house. If I hear that I'm getting a phone call or text message, I immediately get afraid that he's calling or sending me a weird message. He's moved to a different country, but I'm always in fear that I'll even see him. I even saw an American who vaguely looked like him on my trip to Japan and I went into panic mode.

It's even hard to go to sleep sometimes because I'm afraid of dreaming about him. Since back at home for now, my mom has been so helpful with talking to me about it, but it's still incredibly difficult. I dealt with anxiety most of my life and did an incredible job at dealing with it to the point where it felt that it would never come back. After having him at my house, it feels 5-10 times worse than it has ever been. I know I'll probably never see him again, but it feels like I'm going to lose my mind! 

What should I do? I really need help.",you might be harassing them without them knowing or else they may not like you very much i reckon just send one of them whats going on messages and leaving it until they reply most likely youre overreacting and its not even about you
7,I'm sick of anxiety.,I'm sick of feeling scared. I'm sick of my chest feeling tight for no reason. I'm sick of my head feeling weird and tight whenever I think about it. I want to be free. I want to feel happy again. I'm sick of feeling like I'm gonna die. I'm sick of thinking I'll get a heart attack. I'm sick of all of that. I need help. I want my happiness again.,yes i am like this and quite sure i have hypochondria i stopped googling bc i used to be so obsessive about it id go to er often but i still have anxiety about things like this its all in our head but it feels reality hard to believe id be healthy
65,For those who have gotten therapy...,"I am thinking about getting therapy because I have been having random panic attacks out of nowhere and it feels like they are ruining my life.  They are so bad that I throw up, sweat like crazy, and just feel like I'm dying.  I need them to stop, but I don't know if therapy will help or not? If anyone has ever been to therapy for something similar, did it actually help?",your employer may also have an employee assistance program that provides therapy this year i started with cognitive processing therapy cpt after trying talk therapy cognitive behavioral therapy cbt with the cpt theres a set sessions which i was highly skeptical of with tools you work through and have long past it npr i think did a episode on cpt where she did a session a day to get through the days for me it worked combined with assistance with medication and has helped me work through quite a lot that the other types that didnt for meyou can also reach out to a local medical school and see if they have a department of psychiatry that may offer outpatient adult services most have switched to telemedicine so you dont have to be in person for them
16,"If someone doesn't reciprocate convo often enough, do they not wanna be friends?","Trying to figure out if people wanna be friends (or more with women). I don't if there are any rules, or at what point I should take people's actions meaning they're not interested.

I'm wondering: if it feels like I initiate the text convos more often, does it mean they're not interested?",well first of all its not silly you cant judge anyone for something like that its a fear and its valid being open and honest about how you feel with your family members is key honest communication is a life saver if they love you they will try to understand thats if you communicate assertively assertively communication means a person stands up for their own wants and needs while also taking into consideration the needs and wants of others without behaving passively or aggressively assertive communication is helping me tremendously with finding out what my wants and needs are
40,Unable to control my hands?,"So this happened to me a few hours ago and I don't really know what to think of it.

So, today I was stressed the entire day, but I was utilizing healthy coping mechanisms to keep my anxiety under control (mostly breathing exercises, grounding techniques and using fidgets when I was having problems focusing on work). 

I had everything under control until I went into my room after dinner. My right hand started to wave at my right side, almost like I was ruffling the hair of a small child. I couldn't understand why it was happening or control my hand, and then my left hand started waving. 

The waving got more violent. I wanted to stop so I managed to clench my fists together, but then it was like I was stuck. I clenched my fists together and my nails dug into the palms of my hands. I was stuck like this for maybe 45 seconds... then it just stopped. 

Afterwords I was completely discombobulated and exhausted. It was a terrifying experience that I've never been through before... has this happened to anyone else? Any insights or advice for situations like this would be extremely helpful. Thank you

More information: I have GAD and depression, and I am not currently taking medication.",i also wanted to add that the only thing that has helped me over the years with this is doing positive things for my health that make me feel awesome and make me think wow if im eating all organic and running there is no way i have cancer like yoga badass nutrition walking moving running
