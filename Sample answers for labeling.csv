1,I'm actually kinda worried,"I'm a freaking idiot

Ok so I watched a few disturbing videos on YouTube and now I've been thinking what if this video kills me after watching it and it's really been messing with my mind so could say whether it's possible to die after watching a YouTube video",was it like one of those videos that says youll die a week aftet watching it or something

Ok so I watched a few disturbing videos on YouTube and now I've been thinking what if this video kills me after watching it and it's really been messing with my mind so could say whether it's possible to die after watching a YouTube video",maybe it depends a lot on what we actually mean by relaxedlike theres sitting in a sunny beach without a care in the world kind of relaxed and then theres going about your day in a serene kind of way relaxed the former is unattainable without the latter i guess like you can sit on a sunny beach and still worry about every little thingfirstly you need balance like it would be hard to be serene working hour weeks but then not working studying at all has its own burdens so you need a balance between being challenged and free time that said social media tv and games doesnt really count as free time these things are kind of empty stimulation like youre stimulated but theres no satisfaction beyond that it comes down to all the things we struggle to do minimise caffeine alcohol other drugs maximise deep breathing mindfulness cbt act

4,"Having really bad anxiety, and especially about earthquakes.","I moved to LA almost two years ago now so you think I would have better coping mechanisms by now. I think it's a mixture of the lock down, and the fact there have been a few earthquakes lately. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to just relax. It's a very real threat and I have an emergency plan in place. I'm honestly more worried about being hurt, or worse if one does happen. 

I struggle from pretty sever anxiety in general and I'm usually able to manage it, but I've been laying in bed for hours with my heart racing unable to sleep.",i swear by those breathing exercises on youtube they arent a miracle cure or anything but they allow you to focus on the video rather than your thoughts and get some hopefully clarity it may or may not work for you xx

7,Dating a new guy and Overthinking,"Hi guys, 

So I matched with and started talking with this guy on Bumble about a month or two ago. We've had a few virtual dates and he's super sweet and I really like him. We've talked about basic things and have gotten into quite a few deep conversations. We also broke quarantine to go hiking together at a state park and we connected even more so in person than over the phone. He asked me later on if there were any thoughts I hadn't expressed when we were together. 

**--and cue the overthinking--**

I've been overthinking things between him and I quite a bit today and I hate it. I'm self-conscious and insecure about certain parts of my body and I'm afraid that he'll see me as I see myself. Also, whenever he asks me what I got up to today, I'm worried that my answers of not being active will make him not like me. (He exercises quite a bit and is hella **jacked;** he was a really big athlete and it's like he's all muscle.) On my Bumble profile, I said that I was active because, since I was at school when I made the profile, I was normally walking everywhere. Now, it's been hard for me to get up the motivation to go outside and do things especially since I normally don't have people to do them with.

The other factors that come into play here are: I get attached very easily, I tend to experience emotions more strongly than others, I have abandonment issues, and various other mental health issues, including a personality disorder and various instances of trauma. 

Some advice I need is -- what can I do about the overthinking? Should I tell him about the things I've been overthinking? I'm afraid to tell him some things just because I'm afraid he'll judge me or he'll leave me -- (despite my brain understanding that he has previously said he won't judge me)

Basically, I need help figuring out what to say to him and how to say it. I just need some help and some validation too.

Would be very appreciative of any advice you guys can give me. Thank you!!",i also overthink like crazy something i have learned is that if someone doesnt like you then they are not going to keep talking to you if they dont like the way you look there not going to pretend like they do when i get really deep into my overthinking it takes a little bit to get me out but you just have to keep reminding yourself that you have to just let things happen let them be what they will be dont waste time thinking about what ifs of course you can talk to him and tell him how you feel but just know what things you should and shouldnt say in the beginning stages i tend to not bring up too many of my problems as it can overwhelm some people i also hate putting my problems onto other people so just be aware of what problems are just your personal problems and what ones are ones that they could support you or help you with

10,I really need some tips..,"So, I will have to do my book presentation next week in a Zoom lesson. Now, I just can't talk in those lessons, because im insanely anxious about it, so I just say that I don't have a mic. Problem is, the teacher that I will present my presentation knows that you can talk even without mic using phone. I am really scared to think what would happen if he would tell me to talk... does anyone have a solution for this?",what calming techniques work off the zoom call if sensory items work maybe holding something calming like an animal fidget tool stress ball or something can help you through itmaybe practice in front of other peopleor when its time to do your presentation put something over your screen except the camera so you arent looking at them just look at youre prepared presentation insteadremember that its a new situation but you can adapt and get through it put some positive reminders around you so you see that when youre doing your presentation or even have someone that calms you there with you for supportgood luck you got this

13,I want to go outside but I'm anxious,"I just got a new bike and I want to ride it everyday but everytime I even think about doing it at that moment (just going when I want) I get anxious because I feel very awkward just cycling around the neighborhood alone, without a clear purpose. As if people would know it and find it weird. That's why I don't go on walks or jogs, even though I love them.

So what do I do? I find excuses. Oh, it's too hot. It's too cold! The wind is howling, it'll be annoying anyway. You don't have time, you've got an online class in 3 hours, you'll be late! Shit like that that helps me feel better that I don't go outside. (plus the occasional scenarios in which I die)

How do you deal with this? I usually can do it just fine if I'm going with a friend but right now that isn't an option.

Tl;dr how do you deal with anxiety about being outside without a clear purpose?",go on google maps find a place youd like to see doesnt matter where and bam you have a goal and a purpose

19,"Do I have telephobia? (and if so, what can I do in my situation)","Throughout my life I have always been anxious with telephone conversations - particularly with people I have not met face-to-face. I have recently read about telephobia (the fear of making or taking phone calls), and wondered whether it is something real and something that I genuinely suffer from.

I'm a UK secondary (high school) teacher (26M). I would describe myself as a charismatic and confident teacher. I love the social element of my job and have zero trouble with teaching classes or speaking in front of groups of people I have never met before.

Under lockdown, I have been asked by the school to phone call each of my students in my tutor group (around 30 students) once a week for a welfare check. Each phone call is around 5-10 minutes. In short, it is a phone call to have a conversation with parents/carers and their child to see if they are safe with living at home during lockdown.

I have forced myself to make these phone calls with success, however I experience the following:
- delaying the calls until Thursday/Friday, due to reluctance to make the calls
- taking around 20 minutes to mentally prepare myself to start the phone calls
- feelings of anxiousness whenever I remind myself about the phone calls
- refusal to call anyone while my girlfriend is at home (she works 5am-1pm every weekday), in fear of her hearing my conversation
- shaking and increased heart rate before, during and briefly after each phone call
- during the phone call, I speak well as long as I have my notes, despite the shaking and increased heart rate
- I don't stumble my words and the verbal flow of my side of the conversation seems to be fine

I really wish these calls could be all done via email but the school have said it must be a phone call, which I completely understand from a safeguarding point of view.

Question: Do I have telephobia and if so, what can I do to help with this situation?

Any help would be massively appreciated.",no one here can diagnose you with a disorder please see a certified mental health professional for that

22,"Long time lurker, scared to take the first step towards therapy.","Hi all, I've been a part of this sub for a long time but never posted. I met with a new GP for our first appointment virtually and when she saw my diagnosis of anxiety was very encouraging about pursuing therapy, and even gave me some good advice about finding a therapist.

But the idea of even pursuing therapy frightens me. I worry that maybe I'm ""misdiagnosed”, or my anxiety isn't bad enough. I feel like I'm not good at being able to explain my symptoms or my thoughts and feelings.  I question myself wondering if I really need it, even though a part of me feels like I do.

I guess I'm wondering if anyone else here has felt the same way and how they moved past it?",its normal to feel apprehensive of something youve never done before whether you need it or not can only really be decided by you but i feel like a lot of the questions youre asking might be solved by giving it a try if it turns out you dont like it or it isnt for you at least youll know and not wonder about the road not taken hope this helped

My partner and I picked up our goldendoodle puppy in early March, and let me start by saying I love him so, so much, and overall, he has helped with my GAD, especially with the current state of the world. At the end of the day though, all I can think about is if I'm going to do something that's going to be a potentially fatal mistake for the puppy, or how horrible it's going to be when it's his time to cross over the rainbow bridge in (hopefully) 12-15 years from now. In regards to the worries that I'm going to somehow hurt/kill my pup, I thought I would feel better now that he's all up to date with his heartworm & flea/tick medications, as well as vaccinations, but now I've just moved on to how scared I am of him dying years from now.  I'm trying to stay mindful and in the moment, but I'm definitely struggling, and it sucks, because it's taking away from enjoying my sweet puppy now. Does/has anyone struggled with something like this with their animal? If so, how did you manage it?

43,Does anyone out there have anxiety attacks that are purely physical?,"I have always struggled with no one understanding how my anxiety attacks are and not being able to explain them in a way people understand. It gets incredibly frustrating for both parties and just makes it worse for me sometimes. My anxiety attacks are totally a physical experience. I don't have racing thoughts, in fact, I could be thinking about rainbows and cheeseburgers and have a full blown anxiety attack. My head gets insanely tingly out of nowhere and even though I know it's an anxiety attack, I panic that there's something physically wrong with me and it just spirals from there.  I've always been a hypochondriac, and when I was younger and learned the symptoms of stroke, heart attack, etc, my body would literally mimic the symptoms during an anxiety attack (but again, my actual thoughts would be fine up until that point). I've become a pro at looking cool as a cucumber exteriorly, which is great, except no one takes me seriously when I'm in the middle of a seriously bad anxiety attack. Anytime I have one and disclose that to someone, they will (innocently and kindly) ask, ""well what are you anxious about?” And it's like I am anxious about absolutely nothing, my body just feels weird out of nowhere and it's terrifying.

Does anyone else experience this? Do you have any coping mechanisms that help you?

52,"Do I have telephobia? (and if so, what can I do in my situation)","Throughout my life I have always been anxious with telephone conversations - particularly with people I have not met face-to-face. I have recently read about telephobia (the fear of making or taking phone calls), and wondered whether it is something real and something that I genuinely suffer from.

I'm a UK secondary (high school) teacher (26M). I would describe myself as a charismatic and confident teacher. I love the social element of my job and have zero trouble with teaching classes or speaking in front of groups of people I have never met before.

Under lockdown, I have been asked by the school to phone call each of my students in my tutor group (around 30 students) once a week for a welfare check. Each phone call is around 5-10 minutes. In short, it is a phone call to have a conversation with parents/carers and their child to see if they are safe with living at home during lockdown.

I have forced myself to make these phone calls with success, however I experience the following:
- delaying the calls until Thursday/Friday, due to reluctance to make the calls
- taking around 20 minutes to mentally prepare myself to start the phone calls
- feelings of anxiousness whenever I remind myself about the phone calls
- refusal to call anyone while my girlfriend is at home (she works 5am-1pm every weekday), in fear of her hearing my conversation
- shaking and increased heart rate before, during and briefly after each phone call
- during the phone call, I speak well as long as I have my notes, despite the shaking and increased heart rate
- I don't stumble my words and the verbal flow of my side of the conversation seems to be fine

I really wish these calls could be all done via email but the school have said it must be a phone call, which I completely understand from a safeguarding point of view.

Question: Do I have telephobia and if so, what can I do to help with this situation?

Any help would be massively appreciated.",i have social anxiety but have never heard of telephobia but definitely hate talking on the phone would you feel better doing a video chat that may help make it feel more like a face to face conversation also it may help students not only have more normal social interaction by also help with abuse victims who are scared to talk about it

Any help would be massively appreciated.",sharp chest pains to dull chest pains ill also get sick sometimes like throw up i get shakey and bright red i also now have incredibly high blood pressure
54,does anyone here have experience with emotional support animals?,"hi everyone! ive had generalised anxiety disorder for my entire life and recently its become a lot worse (due to the pandemic & me trying to complete my last year of high school). i happened to casually bring up the idea of a therapy animal in conversation with my mother the other day and even though nothing has been finalised as of yet she seems very enthusiastic!as ive never owned a pet before im a bit tentative, so if you own/have owned, or have stories about, emotional support animals, i would love to hear them! thanks guys :)",so the thing with emotional support animals is that you can get them certified yourself although this is the case the animal itself wont have any specific duties to help you with like service animals would furthermore its just a certificate to take your dog anywhere and everywhere but you are not protected under the ada under the service dog category esas are great for your at home time which is obviously the case now but you cant do much outside of this especially on rd party establishments there are studies that show dogs lower your anxiety and stress if you simply engage with them for minutes a day so if you really want to give it a shot train them from a young age to keep their behavior consistent when theyre around you and take it from there

57,How can I help my brother with social anxiety?,"Hi everyone. I'm cross posting from r/relationships to get as much help as I can on this. 

I'm at a loss of how to help him and perhaps need a different perspective. 

My brother (15M) wasn't always like this. When he was younger, he was able to talk to others without a hitch and could even make friends easily (or more easily than now). Over the last four or so years, he's gotten more and more reclusive and hides away in his room unable to talk to others besides our immediate family. He dreads presentations at school, hides away in the library at lunch to avoid talking to/being around others, can't order things he needs whether it's food or talking to a cashier, etc. He is unable to ask questions in his classes to his teachers and his grades aren't that great. 

The most alarming signs are that he seeks food as a comfort to the point where he's overweight now and he tried to self harm by cutting himself around last year but I thankfully caught it in the early stages and he's since stopped. He's turned to video games as well and barely speaks to us. It's incredibly difficult for him to open up and share his feelings and I'm worried most about that aspect. I'm the closest to him and yet it's like pulling nails to get him to tell me what's wrong and that he'd rather keep it all to himself. 

I've tried to intervene and help him by taking him on a shopping spree to make him feel better about himself and spend time with him everyday so he knows he has someone who he can always come to for anything. I've taken him to my therapist (more like forced him to come with me) and he opened up but isn't all that keen on going back and continuing. I've tried to get him to do activities with me so he'd get some exercise in because I know if he'd get moving, he'd feel a whole lot better in general. He refuses and won't come along with me so I'm really at a loss about this issue. Our parents swear nothing is wrong even though there's clearly an issue and I'm afraid if he continues like this, it'll take a lot longer to correct. I don't want him to get bullied or hurt because of this; he has a soft heart and it would destroy me. 

What are some things I can do to help him? Everything I've tried hasn't really come to fruition but I don't want to give up. 

TLDR: Brother refuses any help I offer to help improve his condition. I'm all out of ideas to help but don't want to give up.",talk to him and tell him you want to help even if he doesnt want to talk about problems talk to him about something let him know your there do things together or watch him do things like play video games and learn what he likes as he lets you in more encourage him to do things but dont force it into him try to maybe take a walk out in public with him and be around people but let him know youre there it might take baby steps but this is how i over came my anxiety and he is very fortunate to have someone who cares about him as much as you do i wish the both of you the best

63,"heart palpitations, feeling faint/lightheaded, crying, hands shaking, insomnia, random pains","I've always suspected that I had anxiety because I overthink everything and panic for no reason, but never talked to a doctor about it because of my mother.

Anyway for about a day or so I've had a sudden onslaught of severe symptoms—heart pounding, feeling like I'm going to pass out, crying, shaky hands, insomnia, chest pains, and sometimes headaches. I also feel sick and nauseated constantly now and I can't eat anything without getting stomach pains and (tmi) also having diarrhea whenever I do eat anything. I'm not sure if I'm actually physically ill or if I'm suddenly developing some kind of intense mental illness. The feelings go away when I sleep and when I wake up my calm lasts for an hour or so before all the symptoms of whatever this is start to come back.
I don't know if it's malaise because the symptoms are almost exactly the same and I should get checked for an infection or sickness or if it's anxiety.

70,always afraid of sending my picture online,"so i'm always afraid of sending my picture to people i meet online and there are a lot of times where i like the other person but the anxiety of them not gonna like how i look draws me back and they leave. even in the rare cases where i send my picture, i ends up to be not their type (which basically their kind way of saying you're ugly) and that what makes me think twice before sending it. now i'm in the same situation, the other person is asking for my picture and i really like him but i'm just so afraid of what they're gonna think of me! any advice?

p.s. i don't really think i'm ugly",ive felt like this so so many timesi try to keep several things in mind that have helped me out in situations like this first just because someone isnt attractive to you doesnt mean they are ugly think about the times youve been out in public is everyone you see only either super attractive or ugly no plenty of the people arent bad looking just not your type do you think badly of them if you dont then give these people you are talking with the benefit of the doubt that they may see things in a similar way not being attracted to is not the same as not being attractive another thing to try is look at this as a sorting hat moment do you want to spend time with someone who doesnt think you are awesome interesting and attractive this person just did you a favor and removed themselves from your consideration and you no longer have to spend another thought on if they are worth your attention online dating isnt like most other interactions with people it has different dynamics compared to meeting people in person as impersonal as it sounds i really think its closer to applying for a job theres a lot of sending your resume out going through who knows how many first interviews second interviews etc before something comes through online dating isnt totally analogous to job hunting but there are a lot of similarities including understanding that not being selected does not mean you arent desirable

I've been to a doctor and have a clean bill of health recently so I know it's all in my head.",i cant give you a diagnosis since im not a doctor but i experience the same thing anxiety all my life first prescribed xanax at im now and multiple anxiety meds and ssris throughout my life i dont tolerate ssris well at alli get up at am work at every morning im in the bathroom times always loose and as soon as im ready to walk out the door im back in there once again before i can leave and it doesnt matter if i leave the house at am or noon i cant leave the house without going once more then throughout the day im in the bathroom a few more times i spent years working customer service for chase credit cards very stressful it was a few years in when i started making trips to the the bathroom all day long i exhausted my fmla and quit or i would have been fired for absenteeism after many doctors gastrointerologist tests colonoscopy i was diagnosed with ibs brought on by anxietyalthough all my tests results were always fine this was the diagnosis they came up with did they just pull it out of the air i dont know but after years of doctors and tests i finally had a diagnosis and that alone took away a lot of stressanxiety can wreaked havoc on our bodies in many ways most dont even seem logical i try not to stress yeah right and dont eat spicy acidic or foods with insoluble fiber it moves things through faster instead i try to eat clean and healthy and take in soluble fiber like oatmeal it slows things down i still deal with it every day that doesnt mean you willabout weeks ago i started zoloft again not getting full effect yet but forcing myself to stick with it until some mild side effects pass i believe if i can shake the anxiety my ibs will lighten upi wish i could give you a definitive answer but know you are not alone or the only one who has this happen anxiety meds andor counseling might help if youre like me you probably keep everything inside try to let it out talk with someone go for a walk try meditation relaxing music anything that works to make you feel calm and be sure to drink lots of water so you stay hydrated best of luck keep us updated
79,Confusing,Whenever people come up to me and say hi or hey does this mean they want to talk to me or that there just saying hi. One of my friends told me that's how ppl start conversations. The only problem with this is that l I don't realize and whenever I do I just give 1 or two-word responses.,look up some stuff about small talk it didnt really help me make any friends but it does help to feel prepared one or two word responses can very easily be considered rude by lots of people so you should probably work on that

82,Is there any way to stop an anxiety attack almost instantly?,"I don't want to live this way, it's getting worse :(",this might seem kinda dumb but one thing that might work is saving a picture on your phone mine is of a pokemon and just tell yourself in your head that this image has the power to stop your anxiety in its tracks if you always have your phone on you like me you can just pull that pic out whenever you feel one coming and it could at least ease it a bit

84,Is there any way to stop an anxiety attack almost instantly?,"I don't want to live this way, it's getting worse :(",please dont give up if i can move forward from debilitating anxiety you can too ive had a very rough go of it but it always gets better always my first suggestion based on your post is to stay away from social media i must limit my exposure to social media and it helps a lot i rarely get on facebook and when i do something triggers me i just have to stay away reddit isnt too bad because i have more control over what i see theres a lot more things you can do to help your situation but i would need more information about your thought processes and how you react to situations im more than happy to talk with you any time are you currently seeing a professional counselor or something along those linesedit grammar
85,To give my dog the walks that he deserves,"I have recently stopped walking my dog around because of the stress I get from saying good morning to people. (I usually go at the ass crack of dawn because there's only 3 people I need to ""interact with"" rather than like 7 I guess)

My predicament:

I walk and then a stranger says good morning. Sometimes if I'm too scared, I'll just look down at the ground before they even come close to me to avoid talking.

Result: I feel horrible, they probably feel horrible 

 If I look up, and they try to make eye contact, I panic. They say the good 'ol ""morning!"". I don't respond because I'm busy panicking and I react too slow.

Result: I think that they hate me and I hate myself for it

I tried to make the first move a few times and I say good morning like a brave little girl. It fizzles out like a flat soda and I mumble. 

Result: I say ""gmurnen"" and only mosquitoes can actually hear me

Am I missing a clear compromise here or do I have to keep powering through staring at the ground or those stupid ""gmurnen""s?

&gt; I actually haven't been diagnosed officially, but I stress about these social interactions so much to the point where I just assume I have it.",well i think you should keep trying it i had the same issue when going in to workyou probably know already that these people dont really care much about whether you say it or not they might be a bit disappointed if you dont reply but they wont even remember it after a few minutes that moment isnt the most important part of their day and it should not be yours eitherjust keep saying your gmurnens and try to be a little bit louder each time you dont have to go from nothing to a super happy good morning right away just take your time and practice

96,I just really need some help :(,So I started struggling with anxiety off and on since I was 14 (currently 21) and it's really come to a head which I'm in college and has been especially bad in 2020 for obvious reasons. Within the past 2 months it's gotten reallyyy bad I can't sleep without taking melatonin (often not going to bed until between 2-4 am) and the sleep I do get is often restful or deep sleep and it's deeply impairing my brain functioning. It's causing conflicts with my parents (who I live with) bc I'm so agitated bc how high my anxiety is which is furthering the anxiety. I also often feel like I'm being choked and can't breathe and I've been shaking really bad lately too. It's honestly been so bad I seriously thought about calling out work today. Before the pandemic I was going to the gym everyday and that was really the only thing helping me but now they've been closed for 2 months and my state is opening them back up on Monday but I don't feel safe going back just yet. I go to a therapist every other week and have avoided going to a psychiatrist and getting on medication bc I'm worried about the potential side effects but it's honestly effecting me in every facet of my life and I really just need some advice bc idk what else to do at this point 🙃,i have abilify on me which isnt a medication you take daily its an antipsychotic so you take it when youre feeling symptoms and it calms you down pretty quickly few side effects if youre not taking it regularly helps me sometimes but thats just a bandaid solution talk to your therapist about anxiety strategieshttpswwwhealthlinecomhealthhowtocalmdownhttpswwwhealthlinecomhealthhowtocalmdown

104,Very anxious about graduating and finding a job due to past work trauma + lack of direction [also need hug and support😞],"I am currently doing a Bachelor of science, majoring in psychology, and I am about to graduate. My anxiety and over thinking has led me go question whether this was even the right path many tines, or whether I suit the work lifestyle we have now. I've caught myself overthinking multiple times over things I can't control (Why was I born in a society like this? Why am I like this? Why is the work life so demanding? Why can't I just live peacefully?), and it only frustrates me to the point where I cry myself to sleep. 

From this over thinking, I believe it all started when I worked at a cafe for 2 months, 3 years ago. It was my first job and the manager was really toxic - she would be question how I got into my degree (she assumed I academically dumb at first), yell at me when I wasn't fast enough (to be fair I find it really difficult to remember the proportions of ingredients for the drink because there was so many), and guilt trip me to quit. I felt like such a failure for not being able to work under pressure and remember things that other people could. Now I realise that the behaviour is toxic and not everyone is like that but it has really deepened my anxiety and depression, especially towards work. Since the cafe 3 years ago, I haven't worked since.

I guess another question I'd like to ask is how to deal with the feelings of anxiety and depression. Ive noticed that when Im stressed or frustrated, I have a very heavy feeling in my heart thats sometimes quite painful. like a tightening around the heart. I have tried exercising and sighing it out but it doesn't exactly help. I realised that this can last quite a while and is one of the causes to a spiral of anxious and depressive thoughts.

tl:dr I have anxiety and had work trauma and idk what to do now because I am about to graduate.",i am on the same page my anxiety roots from a trauma i experience right after my master degree during high school and college i was among the top students and as far as i remember always strived to reach the top after graduating from college i decided that i want to continue my graduate studies in a different country this turned out to be my worst best decision the master study in that country was so intensive that it only takes one year to complete this was very different from the education system in my home country few months into the course i had my worst times of coping with anxiety and panic attacks at the time i was young and did not even know whats wrong or where to seek help long story short i ended up submitting my final thesis two hours late literally two hours and that cost me a cap on my final markgiven ive never experienced failure before it was a massive trauma and i spent the subsequent years just recovering from that i was feeling absolutely miserable applying for jobs and not getting them at some point even my references stoped writing a recommendation for my applications then to make ends meet with a master degree i started working in fastfood chains with colleagues cut absolutely from a different clot although it was a good experience i can relate to your story about an abusive managerfast forward with a tremendous effort i admitted to a phd program still the anxiety from my earlier traumatic experience kept returning i was feeling like i am going to experience the same hardship after graduation and whether life is really worth going through this amount of hardshipsometimes i felt like was crippled and i could not concentrate on my task in handit turned out the job hunting this time was much more manageable also i think the economic situation especially the recovery from the great recession of which lasted until could also be blamedi still experience anxiety and absolutely feel you i am just trying to be more conscious and present about my thought process and dont overthink about things that i have no control over them
105,Very anxious about graduating and finding a job due to past work trauma + lack of direction [also need hug and support😞],"I am currently doing a Bachelor of science, majoring in psychology, and I am about to graduate. My anxiety and over thinking has led me go question whether this was even the right path many tines, or whether I suit the work lifestyle we have now. I've caught myself overthinking multiple times over things I can't control (Why was I born in a society like this? Why am I like this? Why is the work life so demanding? Why can't I just live peacefully?), and it only frustrates me to the point where I cry myself to sleep. 

From this over thinking, I believe it all started when I worked at a cafe for 2 months, 3 years ago. It was my first job and the manager was really toxic - she would be question how I got into my degree (she assumed I academically dumb at first), yell at me when I wasn't fast enough (to be fair I find it really difficult to remember the proportions of ingredients for the drink because there was so many), and guilt trip me to quit. I felt like such a failure for not being able to work under pressure and remember things that other people could. Now I realise that the behaviour is toxic and not everyone is like that but it has really deepened my anxiety and depression, especially towards work. Since the cafe 3 years ago, I haven't worked since.

Being around more than one person.

163,Anyone else feel like conversation is just a set of rules and ur always carefully following them and ur constantly trying to not be awkward or weird or talk too much about yourself?,"I dont know if its normal to be like this, sometimes I feel like maybe I have undiagnosed ADHD, but other times I think its just all the anxiety and depression from being a college drop out and being gay and trans. Like am I really this stupid and spacey or did I make myself stupider as a defense mechanism since I didn't have a reason to suddenly be so shit at school?",yes and for me the answer has been to find ways to reduce anxiety and increase mindfulness to be in the present moment its especially hard for me to not fugue off into tons of mental tangents while listening to others i think it helps to remember that your thoughts arent usually as important as you think they are and if you forget to say them its not a big deal compared to the cost of hanging on to them instead of listening it takes a lot of courage to respond authentically to conversation too i mean theres a balance where you dont want to be rude if youre totally bored by a conversation or whatever but for the most part whats the point of having a fake conversation where youre just giving out right answers a huge part of it is just letting go of the need to please or placate others and instead feeling the confidence to be able to be your true self to not feel like theres an obligatory emotional response to what you hear sometimes i just give myself a second to not feel the need to show my automatic response and instead listen to myself for a second in response to what someone has said so i can respond more authentically

Like am I really this stupid and spacey or did I make myself stupider as a defense mechanism since I didn't have a reason to suddenly be so shit at school?",i developed a system of what i call thoughtful conversation built around asking the other person if and what they want to talk aboutif anyone is interested would be happy to explain more about it would post it here but one thing ive noticed to me the very act of posting something is an implicit bid for attention that may or may not be wanted for op are you interested is some advice thoughts or perhaps empathetic listening or validationcan say a reason i researched and developed this system is because of my own anxiety issues with conversation i for me find modern conversational style especially in america where i live to be troublesome and offputting
